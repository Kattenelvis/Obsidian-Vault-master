1.  Let $T$ be a consistent theory without objective truth. THE WORLD can be broken into infinitely many pieces. The theory has only infinite models. The completeness theorem implies that $T$ has a model of every infinite cardinality. Pick a model $M$ of the same cardinality as THE WORLD. Map the individuals of $M$ one-to-one into the pieces of THE WORLD, and use the mapping to define relations of $M$ directly in THE WORLD. The result is a satisfaction relation SAT - a 'correspondence' between the terms of [the language] $L$ and sets of pieces of THE WORLD such that theory $T$, comes out true true of THE WORLD provided we just interpret 'true' as TRUE(SAT). So whatever becomes of the claim that $T$ might be false? (Putnam 1978, pp. 125-126)
