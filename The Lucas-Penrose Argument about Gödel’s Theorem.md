[Lucas-Penrose Argument about Gödel’s Theorem | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (utm.edu)](https://iep.utm.edu/lp-argue/)

The main idea is that a formal system F which is transformed into a Turing Machine which runs F, where F is a w-consistent formal system which contains peano arithmetic, can by Gödel's first incompleteness theorem never prove their own Gödel sentence G, yet a human mind can "understand" G to be true. 

The main counter-argument brought forth by Benacceraff is that human minds are implemented by something much more complicated than Peano arithmetic, and that we can not proove nor see the truth of our own Gödel sentence. This mirrors Daniel Dennetts criticism that humans don't just go around doing Peano arithmetic and nothing else. The Gödel sentences describing a human mind is too complicated for  said human mind to know. So we end up with a disjunction, either we are non-computational, or we don't know our own Gödel sentence. 

Another counter-argument is Putnam's (a philosopher who is a big proponent of the computuational theory of mind) which uses Gödels second incompleteness theorem. Since we cannot prove humans minds implement w-consistent formal systems from itself, then we cannot know whether or not the human mind is computable. Here it is from his article:

"(1) Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem only applies to consistent formal systems. 
(2) Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem establishes that one cannot establish the consistency of a formal system from within the system itself, so 
(3) If we are TMs, we can never establish our own consistency (and cannot, therefore, confidently apply Gödel's First Theorem to ourselves)." (citation)
