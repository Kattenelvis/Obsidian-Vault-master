## Mereology

Axiomatizing folk-physics (the book by ladyman has a reference to this). Ladyman argues that metaphysicians often end up not utilizing physics correctly at all, and saying false things about it constantly (such as saying "space-time points" etc.). But what if we formalized and axioamtized notions of folk-physics and let a robot reason about space-time, even if fundamental physics says it may be reducible?
