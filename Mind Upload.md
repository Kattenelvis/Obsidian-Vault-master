If all goes well, an intelligence explosion raises the possibility of mental uploading
whereby human minds are uploaded as digital simulations within a powerful computer
(Chalmers 2010; Mandelbaum 2022; Pigliucci 2014). Indeed, it is largely this prospect that
drew Chalmers to discuss the singularity hypothesis. The chance of mental uploading
raises a host of questions. Would the resulting upload be conscious (Chalmers 2010; Den-
nett 2012)? Would it be me (Cerullo 2015; Goldwater 2021)? Could mental uploading
allow me to become very long-lived (Smart 2021), and if so would that be a good thing
(Scheffler and Kolodny 2013)?



artificial intelligence presents an existential risk
to humanity (Bostrom 2014; Greaves and MacAskill 2021; Ord 2020),
