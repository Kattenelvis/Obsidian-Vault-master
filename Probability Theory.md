[Strevens: Getting a Handle on Probabilities](http://www.strevens.org/research/physprob.shtml)
"A _probability coordination principle_ instructs us, under certain circumstances, to set our subjective probability for an event equal to the physical probability for the event (and more generally, to set our subjective probability for an event conditional on a theory to the physical probability assigned to the event by the theory). Following these instructions appears to be the principal source of our grasp of the significance of probabilistic claims about the world. I have written on two kinds of questions about probability coordination: the question as to the proper form of the probability coordination principle, and the question as to why we are justified in conforming to the principle."
