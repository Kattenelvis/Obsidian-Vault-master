"A _probability coordination principle_ instructs us, under certain circumstances, to set our subjective probability for an event equal to the physical probability for the event (and more generally, to set our subjective probability for an event conditional on a theory to the physical probability assigned to the event by the theory). Following these instructions appears to be the principal source of our grasp of the significance of probabilistic claims about the world. I have written on two kinds of questions about probability coordination: the question as to the proper form of the probability coordination principle, and the question as to why we are justified in conforming to the principle."



" No, it's worse! He showed the absurdity of frequentism using this absurd experiment: suppose you have two dice. You have a friend who's going to tell you that the sun didn't rise this morning if one of these conditions is respected: 1) the sun didn't rise this morning 2) both dice fell on a 6. With a p-value of 0.05 (probability of being wrong of 1/20 or less), if your friend does tell you that the sun didn't rise, since 1/36 is less than 1/20, according to frequentist methodology you can conclude that the sun indeed didn't rise, because the probability that your friend lied is less than 1/20 (0.05). So it shows that a study's conclusion isn't the same as a personal conclusion or the scientific consensus. All knowledge needs to be considered in the context of all other knowledge. Anyway, I love that a simple "dumb" experiment like this can conclude that the sun didn't rise this morning!"
