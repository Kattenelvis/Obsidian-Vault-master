"Systems of connexive logic are _contra-classical_ in the sense that they are neither subsystems nor extensions of classical logic. Connexive logics have a standard logical vocabulary and comprise certain non-theorems of classical logic as theses. Since classical propositional logic is Post-complete, any additional axiom in its language gives rise to the trivial system, so that any non-trivial system of connexive logic will have to leave out some theorems of classical logic."

Also similar to Relevance logic in that logical implication needs to have the antecedent and consequent be relevant to eachother

"Note that AT follows from BT′ and AT′ follows from BT in logics in which _A_ → _A_ is theorem and modus ponens is an admissible inference rule."
