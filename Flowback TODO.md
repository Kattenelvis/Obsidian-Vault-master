The great flowback rework/refactor of 2025

- API rework in conversation with Siamand
- Analyze the code for unnecessary stuff
- Modularity and expandability
- Fixing problems at their core
- Decrease code count by 10-20%
- Research svelte and svelte kit 5, push up to standard (runes maybe?)
- Research code standard and large scale maintainability (like +server.svelte, +layout.svelte etc)
- Optimizing by minimizing API calls, page loads etc
- Playwright tests for the frontend
- Ask about future features to prepare for those
- Calculations in C on bet calculations
- Backend renaming group tagss to group tags (or area etc we'll see)
- Merge back and frontend into one repository?
- "One click" docker setup
- Gamification
- Preparing for future features
- Alignment scores
- Better poppup and feedback system 
- For most API calls, receive the item, not just the id, so we don't need to double the amount of work in the frontend
- Backend refactoring of Poll process, notifications, removing delegate pools
