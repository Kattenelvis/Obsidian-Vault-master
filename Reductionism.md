> A reduction is effected when the experimental laws of the secondary science (and if it has an adequate theory, its theory as well) are shown to be the logical consequences of the theoretical assumptions (inclusive of the coordinating definitions) of the primary science. (Nagel 1961: 352)

[Scientific Reduction (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/)

Three types of reductionism

1. Ontological, that some properties supervene or is token-token identical with a lower level properties. Related to physicalism, and the reduction of biological properties to biochemical properties. Also the question of emergence
   
2. Methodological, that research is best pursued via looking at the parts and their interactions of a system. Some argue that in biology, sometimes the whole system has certain features that cannot be analyzed from analyzing the parts.

3. Epistemic. It can be motivated with (Ontological $\wedge$ Methodological) $\rightarrow$ Epistemic. But it's not enough!


“Nagel model of reduction” can be fully specified as follows: Reduction is 

(i) a kind of explanation relation, which 

(ii) holds between two theories if and only if 

(iii) one of these theories is derivable from the other, 

(iv) with the help of bridge laws under some conditions.


Fayerabend criticises Nagel, Schaffner's model fixes it. 


[Reductionism in Biology (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reduction-biology/)
"Since the reduction of one theory to another usually presumes that somehow the reducing theory _explains_ the principles of the reduced theory, reduction is also related to the issue of [scientific explanation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/). For example, if a more fundamental theory fully reduces another theory or even reduces several theories, [unification](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/) (of some sort) results. The situation where a historically earlier theory is reduced to a later theory is an intuitive case in which [scientific progress](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-progress/) might occur. Arguments against the existence of this type of historical reduction have maintained that terms occurring in both the precursor and descendant theory have different meanings (“[incommensurability](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/)”)."

"This indicates that questions about reduction also connect to the meaning of scientific terms and conceptual change. Therefore, accounts of reduction often involve commitments made about other notions and their adequacy depends in many cases on these related philosophical commitments. This has led some philosophers to pursue an account of reduction in biology that is as uncommitted as possible regarding the precise construal of general notions such as “law” and “explanation” (Sarkar 1998, cf. Brigandt 2013a), or to specifically highlight how a particular package of general notions travels together and skews our perspective on the shape of epistemic reduction in scientific practice"



Special relativity is the vacuum solution to Einsteins field equation, giving a hempel reduction (not even schaffer(!)) for special relativity.
