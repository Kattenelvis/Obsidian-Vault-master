Anthropic Bias by Nick Boström


> The design hypothesis states that our universe is the result of purposeful
design. The “agent” doing the designing need not be a theistic God,
although that is of course one archetypal version of the design hypothesis.
Other universe-designers have been considered in this context. For exam-pie, John Leslie (Leslie 1972, 1979, 1989) discusses the case for a neopla-
tonist “causally efficacious ethical principle”, which he thinks might have
been responsible for creating the world and giving physical constants and
cosmological parameters the numerical values they have. 


> Derek Parfit (Parfit
1998) considers various “universe selection principles”, which, although
they are very different from what people have traditionally thought of as
“God” or a “Designer,” can nevertheless suitably be grouped under the
heading of design hypotheses for present purposes. 


> One prominent champion of the fine-tuning argument for God’s
existence is Richard Swinburne (Swinburne 1991). Several other theologians
and philosophers also support this position (see e.g. (Polkinghorne 1986;
Craig 1988, 1997; Manson 1989)).

> While it is true that our knowledge of “exotic”
life forms possible under different physical laws than the ones that hold in
the actual world is very limited (Feinberg and Shapiro 1980; Smith 1985 Wilson 1991)

Wheeler type cyclic universe with changing constants or Carter multiverse is an instance of the Inverse gambler's fallacy

Hacking thinks Carter not Wheeler does this, Boström (and supposidely most) thinks the opposite

IBE bad?

Is the following an example of the lottery paradox? We' expect no individual universe to be the one with life yet we expect atleast one universe to have it.
