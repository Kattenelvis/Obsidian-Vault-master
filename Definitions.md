Empiricist foundationalism: 

There exists primitive terms which refer to sense experience. Terms in the definiandum can be defined as a complex sentence whose atomic terms are primitive terms.

Horse$_1$ =$_{df}$ Four legged creature
Horse$_2$ =$_{df}$ Brown four legged creature

The definians's above can be rewritten into primitives, like "brown" and "four" in a logical form, or as a set constructor.

Horse$_1$ =$_{df}$ $4Legs(x)\wedge creature(x)$
Horse$_2$ =$_{df}$ $4Legs(x)\wedge creature(x) \wedge brown(x)$

Brown is a primitive, four is a construction (and mathematical objects have a phenomenology) and creature is complicated since it's based on biology. Most likely something like object that tries to achieve homeostatic equilibrium, pushes against thermodynamic forces by the environment, tries to stay alive, tries to reproduce, performs metabolism.
