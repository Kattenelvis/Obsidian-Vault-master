Argument against physicalism:
Assumption 1: Identity theory, mental processes are brain processes. $M=P$
Assumption 2: Thought is a rational process $R(M_{thought})$
Assumption 3: Physical processes are irrational processes $\forall P \neg R(P)$
Assumption 4: Identity of indiscernible $M=P\rightarrow (\forall Q Q(M)\leftrightarrow Q(P))$
Contradiction: They have different properties, sp $M\neq P$


AMBIVALENT is neutral

Omni benevolent = All Good
Omni ambivalent = All Neutral
Omni malevolent = All Evil

[Univocity of being - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univocity_of_being)



Old worldview:

The universal experience is defined to be the union of the experience of all subjects.

$E_t=E_{1,t}\cup E_{2,t} \dots \cup E_{n,t}$

For $n$ subjects in the universe at time t. Define $E$ to be all experience across all time.

B-theoretic formulation where the universe has $T$ timesteps. :
$E=E_1\cup E_2 \dots\cup E_T$

A-theoretic formulation
$E=E_{-FTP}\cup E_{-FTP+1} \dots E_{NOW-1}\cup E_{NOW}\cup E_{NOW+1}\dots E_{LTS-1}\cup E_{LTS}$

Where $FTP$ is the number of timesteps from now to the start, $LTS$ is the number of timesteps until the end of the universe (or until a new cycle begins e.t.c). 

For simplicity we'll only use the B-theretic formulation.

Asumption 1: Metaphysical (Berkleyan) Idealism is true i.e $U=E$ where $U$ is the entire universe. The universe is only sense experience, that is.

Asumption 2: Eternalism is true i.e the experiences at other timesteps than now exist.

Asumption 3: Time has discrete timesteps.

Then $U$ has the following properties:

1. Omniscience
2. Omnipresence
3. Omnitemporality


Assumption 1 is false, epistemic idealism is true. Only omnitemporality but the eternalist asumptions still lingers on





Problem with Ontological Argument: What is a good property?

Negative theology: Finds properties god doesn't have.

Solution: Construction a possible world such that property P is bad. Then $\neg P(G)$. Continue doing this until you have a list of properties that are possibly bad and you're left with, with some probability, properties that are necessarily good.

This requires an axiological system to determine wheter a property P is bad in a world W or not. Problems with omnibenevolence? 


Idea: If hume's guilitione is false and x is omniscient then x is omnibenevolent (it can derive ought's from is's)



If God has goodnes A and God is omnipotent, then god only takes actions that maximise goodness, god would only create the universe if it maximises goodness, the universe has goodness B. A+B>A, so the universe + god has more goodness. Therefore pantheism?


One can construct a possible world where it is bad to be a frog. But could the essence of frogs be to be always good? Not really. "Being frog" is a vague predicate and only the natural properties/universals may count here .


There  could exist something which is omniscient but which has no other properties. An oracle, where you input a statement and it outputs a truth value, or some kind of response atleast. 



Ah I see. I can even see an argument for it.

1. Total hedonic utilitarianism is true
2. If God is omnibenevolent, then given some set of actions, God only takes the action that maximizes total hedonic pleasure in the universe, given it's knowledge
3. If god is omniscient, God knows the consequences of all actions
4. God is omniscient and omnibenevolent
5. God only takes the action that maximizes total hedonic pleasure in the universe
6. God has the power to send souls to heaven or hell
7. Souls going to heaven increases total hedonic utils, hell is negative
8. God is omnibenevolent
9. God chooses to send souls to heaven

Which is equivalent with universalism being true
