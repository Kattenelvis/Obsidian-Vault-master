Argument against physicalism:
Assumption 1: Identity theory, mental processes are brain processes. $M=P$
Assumption 2: Thought is a rational process $R(M_{thought})$
Assumption 3: Physical processes are irrational processes $\forall P \neg R(P)$
Assumption 4: Identity of indiscernible $M=P\rightarrow (\forall Q Q(M)\leftrightarrow Q(P))$
Contradiction: They have different properties, sp $M\neq P$


AMBIVALENT is neutral

Omni benevolent = All Good
Omni ambivalent = All Neutral
Omni malevolent = All Evil

[Univocity of being - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univocity_of_being)



Old worldview:

The universal experience is defined to be the union of the experience of all subjects.

$E_t=E_{1,t}\cup E_{2,t} \dots \cup E_{n,t}$

For $n$ subjects in the universe at time t. Define $E$ to be all experience across all time.

B-theoretic formulation where the universe has $T$ timesteps. :
$E=E_1\cup E_2 \dots\cup E_T$

A-theoretic formulation
$E=E_{-FTP}\cup E_{-FTP+1} \dots E_{NOW-1}\cup E_{NOW}\cup E_{NOW+1}\dots E_{LTS-1}\cup E_{LTS}$

Where $FTP$ is the number of timesteps from now to the start, $LTS$ is the number of timesteps until the end of the universe (or until a new cycle begins e.t.c). 

For simplicity we'll only use the B-theretic formulation.

Asumption 1: Metaphysical (Berkleyan) Idealism is true i.e $U=E$ where $U$ is the entire universe. The universe is only sense experience, that is.

Asumption 2: Eternalism is true i.e the experiences at other timesteps than now exist.

Asumption 3: Time has discrete timesteps.

Then $U$ has the following properties:

1. Omniscience
2. Omnipresence
3. Omnitemporality


Assumption 1 is false, epistemic idealism is true. Only omnitemporality but the eternalist asumptions still lingers on





Problem with Ontological Argument: What is a good property?

Negative theology: Finds properties god doesn't have.

Solution: Construction a possible world such that property P is bad. Then $\neg P(G)$. Continue doing this until you have a list of properties that are possibly bad and you're left with, with some probability, properties that are necessarily good.

This requires an axiological system to determine wheter a property P is bad in a world W or not. Problems with omnibenevolence? 


Idea: If hume's guilitione is false and x is omniscient then x is omnibenevolent (it can derive ought's from is's)



If God has goodnes A and God is omnipotent, then god only takes actions that maximise goodness, god would only create the universe if it maximises goodness, the universe has goodness B. A+B>A, so the universe + god has more goodness. Therefore pantheism?


One can construct a possible world where it is bad to be a frog. But could the essence of frogs be to be always good? Not really. "Being frog" is a vague predicate and only the natural properties/universals may count here .


There  could exist something which is omniscient but which has no other properties. An oracle, where you input a statement and it outputs a truth value, or some kind of response atleast. 



Ah I see. I can even see an argument for it.

1. Total hedonic utilitarianism is true
2. If God is omnibenevolent, then given some set of actions, God only takes the action that maximizes total hedonic pleasure in the universe, given it's knowledge
3. If god is omniscient, God knows the consequences of all actions
4. God is omniscient and omnibenevolent
5. God only takes the action that maximizes total hedonic pleasure in the universe
6. God has the power to send souls to heaven or hell
7. Souls going to heaven increases total hedonic utils, hell is negative
8. God is omnibenevolent
9. God chooses to send souls to heaven

Which is equivalent with universalism being true






Idea: Is The probability distribution of God's existence over possible worlds equal? Maybe not. 

Not all kinds of Gods atleast. A fine-tuner for creating intelligent life would have a higher probability of existing in worlds with intelligent life. Unless it messed up. Why would it mess up if it's omniscient? Perhaps because it thought non-deterministic laws were the best. In which case the mind of God could just run through every possibility at once. Oh damn multiverse theory and and God at the same time? Damn that's a bit cranky. For anyone else reading this, this is just an idea! Nothing rigirious here yet!

A fine tuner probability
$P(H|E)$

Where now $H=$ A fine tuner exists
$E=$ The laws

$$\frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$$

Can you actually calculate $P(E)$?
It can predicate over all worlds with laws (let's call them the nomonological worlds)

But let's atleast assume that $P(E|H)$ is quite large. According to dynamical systems theory, most systems are either very chaotic or very stable (cellullar automata systems atleast). Only a small number is on the edge of chaos where life-like features form (and are also those which are turing complete). For instance, game of life and 1-dimensional 2-color cellullar automata rule 31.




But what about the argument from many sources? That is to say, there are so many arguments for God that the probabilities add up to a large number! Maybe even >0.5. Let's take a look at this argument further

Firstly, let's list some arguments

Cosmological
Ontological
Fine-Tuning
Pascal's Wager
From Beauty
From Meaning
From Morality
Just doing it


Most of these are bad, all 4 at the bottom. Argument from beauty is simply "Beauty exists, beauty exists if and only if God exists, therefore God exists". Meaning and morality is the same. There just simply isn't an iff logical connective between these, or atleast I haven't seen any good arguments for it yet. 

Pascal's wager doesn' give you any probilities that God exist, only that no matter which probability God has of existing, it is rational to believe in God (or some kind of post-life process that can lead to different outcomes) (also, the probability does matter if infinite payouts are no longer there. We'll go over why infinite payouts may not quite work out). 


So let's calculate the probability with the substantive arguments for Gods existence

$c=$ there exists a first causer
$o=$ there exists a being with all necessarily good properties 
$f=$ there exists a law fine tuner towards intelligent life
$g=$ there exists a God

We take it that $g\leftrightarrow (c\vee o\vee f)$

So to find out the probability of Gods existence we take

$$P(c|\neg o \wedge\neg f) + P(o|\neg c \wedge\neg f)+P(f|\neg c \wedge\neg o)  $$

On a set theoretic diagram we get the outer edges.

Then we also have the terms 

OOOOO WAIT There's a simpler way of doing this
Using de morgans law we get
$$P(\neg g)= P(\neg (c\vee o\vee f))=P(\neg c\wedge \neg o\wedge\neg f))$$

$P(g)=1-P(\neg g)=1-P(\neg c\wedge \neg o\wedge\neg f))$


Now of course if the probabilities are independent this becomes quite easy. It's hard to believe that they really are independent, but let's see where it takes us first

$P(g)=1-P(\neg c)P(\neg o)P(\neg f)=1-(1-P(c))(1-P(o))(1-P(f))$







Waging: Pascal vs Roko





List of impossibility theorems:

![[Pasted image 20240605110018.png]]
Mercy $\wedge$ Just $\rightarrow\bot$

Problem of Evil/Teodicé Problem
Omniscient $\wedge$ Omnipotent $\wedge$ Omnibenevolent $\wedge$ Evil/Suffering exists $\rightarrow\bot$

Middle Knowledge
Free Will $\wedge$ Omniscience $\rightarrow\bot$

Omniscient $\wedge$ Perfect $\rightarrow\bot$
![[Pasted image 20240605110042.png]]




Polytheism may not be so different from Theism after all: Any property that some set of Gods have would approximate those of a single God, hence we can talk of God as a collective whenever we say it's omnipresent, omnipotent etc.


Trinity might work. God is a term t(x,y,z) which take on essentially good properties P, Q,.. such that God = G(Holy spirit, Son, Father).




[Arguments for and against Islam? : r/askphilosophy (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1ej4xgo/arguments_for_and_against_islam/)
"I had a professor who made an interesting (albeit general) observation about the difference between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

In Judaism, there is a heavy emphasis on obeying particular laws (e.g., keeping kosher), but the law is understood to apply only to the Jewish people. So, Judaism is not proselytizing.

In Christianity, there is much less of an emphasis on obeying particular laws; rather, the emphasis is on accepting Jesus as savior. But Jesus is understood to have been sent to save everyone, and so Christianity is proselytizing.

In Islam, there is a heavy emphasis on obeying particular laws (i.e., Sharia law), like Judaism - but this law is understood to apply to everyone, and so Islam is also proselytizing, like Christianity. The Islamic law is a law that supposedly applies to everyone.

A possible critique of Islam, as opposed to the other Abrahamic religions, would be that the combination of strict lawfulness with the belief that the law applies to everyone is a uniquely dangerous combination, psychologically speaking.

Obviously, this is an extremely general claim - but it struck me as an interesting observation nonetheless."






Well I personally found it to be a very interesting course. Theology in general goes by the assumption that God exists, and I wanted to figure out if it was positive expected utility to study theology by first figuring out if God exists (one can do Pascal's wager style arguments that one gets positive expected utility from studying theology). The course went in-depth on arguments for and against the existence of God, such as the cosmological argument, ontological argument, the fine-tuning argument, creation of life argument, the cosmic disproportionality argument, the evolutionary argument, the problem of evil and so on. Other parts of the philosophy of religion are vastly less important for maximizing expected utilty given Pascal style arguments, and so I'm less rationally inclined towards studying that.


Well I almost exclusively engage in 21:th and 20:th century philosophy in the analytical tradition. The philosophers I've engaged with the most include Carnap, Chalmers, Ayer, Quine, Russell, Boström, Parfit, Tarski and so on. When it comes to theistic philosophers I've only studied Craig and Plantinga. Almost none of that references the bible or other scripture (I know of 0 examples). Religious scripture is not used as premises in any arguments. One does not need to know arguments in theology or scripture to engage with arguments in this tradition. I personally know almost nothing about scripture, yet I was able to follow the book "Types, Tableux and Gödels God" perfectly well because it includes no references to any scripture, just historical arguments (Such as Descartes, Leibniz, and Kants criticism) and some knowledge of logic (primarily modal logic, free logic, type theory and the logic of definite descriptions). Depending on what counts as "theology", the krakow circle has engaged in what I believe is called "natural theology" under the analytic tradition, and modern analytic thomists do similar arguments but I haven't engaged in that.
