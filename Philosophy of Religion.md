Argument against physicalism:
Assumption 1: Identity theory, mental processes are brain processes. $M=P$
Assumption 2: Thought is a rational process $R(M_{thought})$
Assumption 3: Physical processes are irrational processes $\forall P \neg R(P)$
Assumption 4: Identity of indiscernible $M=P\rightarrow (\forall Q Q(M)\leftrightarrow Q(P))$
Contradiction: They have different properties, sp $M\neq P$


AMBIVALENT is neutral

Omni benevolent = All Good
Omni ambivalent = All Neutral
Omni malevolent = All Evil

[Univocity of being - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univocity_of_being)



Old worldview:

The universal experience is defined to be the union of the experience of all subjects.

$E_t=E_{1,t}\cup E_{2,t} \dots \cup E_{n,t}$

For $n$ subjects in the universe at time t. Define $E$ to be all experience across all time.

B-theoretic formulation where the universe has $T$ timesteps. :
$E=E_1\cup E_2 \dots\cup E_T$

A-theoretic formulation
$E=E_{-FTP}\cup E_{-FTP+1} \dots E_{NOW-1}\cup E_{NOW}\cup E_{NOW+1}\dots E_{LTS-1}\cup E_{LTS}$

Where $FTP$ is the number of timesteps from now to the start, $LTS$ is the number of timesteps until the end of the universe (or until a new cycle begins e.t.c). 

For simplicity we'll only use the B-theretic formulation.

Asumption 1: Metaphysical (Berkleyan) Idealism is true i.e $U=E$ where $U$ is the entire universe. The universe is only sense experience, that is.

Asumption 2: Eternalism is true i.e the experiences at other timesteps than now exist.

Asumption 3: Time has discrete timesteps.

Then $U$ has the following properties:

1. Omniscience
2. Omnipresence
3. Omnitemporality


Assumption 1 is false, epistemic idealism is true. Only omnitemporality but the eternalist asumptions still lingers on





Problem with Ontological Argument: What is a good property?

Negative theology: Finds properties god doesn't have.

Solution: Construction a possible world such that property P is bad. Then $\neg P(G)$. Continue doing this until you have a list of properties that are possibly bad and you're left with, with some probability, properties that are necessarily good.

This requires an axiological system to determine wheter a property P is bad in a world W or not. Problems with omnibenevolence? 


Idea: If hume's guilitione is false and x is omniscient then x is omnibenevolent (it can derive ought's from is's)



If God has goodnes A and God is omnipotent, then god only takes actions that maximise goodness, god would only create the universe if it maximises goodness, the universe has goodness B. A+B>A, so the universe + god has more goodness. Therefore pantheism?


One can construct a possible world where it is bad to be a frog. But could the essence of frogs be to be always good? Not really. "Being frog" is a vague predicate and only the natural properties/universals may count here .


There  could exist something which is omniscient but which has no other properties. An oracle, where you input a statement and it outputs a truth value, or some kind of response atleast. 



Ah I see. I can even see an argument for it.

1. Total hedonic utilitarianism is true
2. If God is omnibenevolent, then given some set of actions, God only takes the action that maximizes total hedonic pleasure in the universe, given it's knowledge
3. If god is omniscient, God knows the consequences of all actions
4. God is omniscient and omnibenevolent
5. God only takes the action that maximizes total hedonic pleasure in the universe
6. God has the power to send souls to heaven or hell
7. Souls going to heaven increases total hedonic utils, hell is negative
8. God is omnibenevolent
9. God chooses to send souls to heaven

Which is equivalent with universalism being true






Idea: Is The probability distribution of God's existence over possible worlds equal? Maybe not. 

Not all kinds of Gods atleast. A fine-tuner for creating intelligent life would have a higher probability of existing in worlds with intelligent life. Unless it messed up. Why would it mess up if it's omniscient? Perhaps because it thought non-deterministic laws were the best. In which case the mind of God could just run through every possibility at once. Oh damn multiverse theory and and God at the same time? Damn that's a bit cranky. For anyone else reading this, this is just an idea! Nothing rigirious here yet!

A fine tuner probability
$P(H|E)$

Where now $H=$ A fine tuner exists
$E=$ The laws

$$\frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$$

Can you actually calculate $P(E)$?
It can predicate over all worlds with laws (let's call them the nomonological worlds)

But let's atleast assume that $P(E|H)$ is quite large. According to dynamical systems theory, most systems are either very chaotic or very stable (cellullar automata systems atleast). Only a small number is on the edge of chaos where life-like features form (and are also those which are turing complete). For instance, game of life and 1-dimensional 2-color cellullar automata rule 31.




But what about the argument from many sources? That is to say, there are so many arguments for God that the probabilities add up to a large number! Maybe even >0.5. Let's take a look at this argument further

Firstly, let's list some arguments

Cosmological
Ontological
Fine-Tuning
Pascal's Wager
From Beauty
From Meaning
From Morality
Just doing it


Most of these are bad, all 4 at the bottom. Argument from beauty is simply "Beauty exists, beauty exists if and only if God exists, therefore God exists". Meaning and morality is the same. There just simply isn't an iff logical connective between these, or atleast I haven't seen any good arguments for it yet. 

Pascal's wager doesn' give you any probilities that God exist, only that no matter which probability God has of existing, it is rational to believe in God (or some kind of post-life process that can lead to different outcomes) (also, the probability does matter if infinite payouts are no longer there. We'll go over why infinite payouts may not quite work out). 


So let's calculate the probability with the substantive arguments for Gods existence

$c=$ there exists a first causer
$o=$ there exists a being with all necessarily good properties 
$f=$ there exists a law fine tuner towards intelligent life
$g=$ there exists a God

We take it that $g\leftrightarrow (c\vee o\vee f)$

So to find out the probability of Gods existence we take

$$P(c|\neg o \wedge\neg f) + P(o|\neg c \wedge\neg f)+P(f|\neg c \wedge\neg o)  $$

On a set theoretic diagram we get the outer edges.

Then we also have the terms 

OOOOO WAIT There's a simpler way of doing this
Using de morgans law we get
$$P(\neg g)= P(\neg (c\vee o\vee f))=P(\neg c\wedge \neg o\wedge\neg f))$$

$P(g)=1-P(\neg g)=1-P(\neg c\wedge \neg o\wedge\neg f))$


Now of course if the probabilities are independent this becomes quite easy. It's hard to believe that they really are independent, but let's see where it takes us first

$P(g)=1-P(\neg c)P(\neg o)P(\neg f)=1-(1-P(c))(1-P(o))(1-P(f))$







Waging: Pascal vs Roko
