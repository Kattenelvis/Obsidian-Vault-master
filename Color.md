Ordinary uses of the word: "C is colored as R" yet do objects have such properties? It seems to be a property of sensations, not objects. 

Locke and Descartes claims that color in the world is not as we think it is. Objects have properties which, in conjunction with some observer, causes the observer to experience R.

This is the continental drift of color perception science

Multiple colors in one region!

Assuming uniform brightness, this is how the H-S (hue-saturation) space looks like. The numbers represent maximum points for human color perception. 

Idea: H-S-B space, now including brightness, is a cylinder and human perception would be some shape within that cylinder. But with singular points at the top (white) and bottom (black).

"By distorting certain phenomenal relationships, other relationships which are more suitable for the purposes at hand can be exhibited felicitously. Its compromises give NCS space a simple and intuitive character which would be sacrificed if accuracy in other respects were attempted. For instance, the Optical Society of America-Uniform Color Space has uniform perceptual intervals between each color sample and its neighbors, but in it there exist no planes of constant hue (Kuehni 1983, 62-67). And if one demands not only that there be perceptual equality of intervals, but also that the sampling be done to the fineness of just-noticeable differences, it appears that the resulting space is not even Euclidean (Judd and Wyszecki, 1963, 309- 310). If we want to go even further and represent phenomenal color relationships in a space that can accommodate the observations of deviant observers, we shall probably require several dimensions (Chang and Carroll 1980)."

"It should be understood that the issue is not that there cannot be a consistent scheme of representing phenomenal color, for there can. And, indeed, there is reason to suppose that the various representations can be mapped into each other (though the mapping relations will often be quite complex). The point is, rather, that one cannot expect any single representation to be serviceable for all purposes, not even if we restrict ourselves to the construction of psychological color spaces rather than, say, spaces whose primary use is in the mixing of colorants."



"(As it is, it is easy to see how useless objectivism is for the red-green incompatibility problem. Take, for instance, the crude case in which being "pure" red is taken to be identical with sending 650 nm light and not other wavelengths, and being "pure" green is taken to be identical with sending 510 nm light and not other wavelengths . Then 'nothing is both pure red and pure green all over at the same time' becomes 'nothing sends 650 nm and 510 nm light to our eyes at the same time'. This is, of course, patently false, since the two lights can readily be superimposed. It is not hard to see that refining and complicating such an objectivist analysis won't help: it just gets off on the wrong foot.)"

"To counter this problem, McLaughlin suggests that we extend a proposal, which Jackson and Pargetter (1987) made, originally to overcome the problem of multiple realizations. They proposed relativising the concept of color, to kinds of objects and circumstances. McLaughlin’s suggestion is that we could extend the objectivist concept of color, by relativising it to individual observers.

Another major objection to the physicalist (reductive) account concerns whether the properties can satisfy the principle of “Unity”, as described by Johnston, ([see section 2.2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/color/#ReduColoPhys)). This principle points to the fact that the various colors, it would seem, are the kinds of properties that fit together in characteristic ways to form structured color arrays, with a distinctive 3-dimensional character, built on attributes such as hue/saturation/brightness (or hue, chroma, lightness). The principle of Unity would seem to pose a serious problem for the Color Physicalist (see Hardin 1988; Thompson 1995; Maund 1995, 2011). As McLaughlin concedes, the problem is

> that no physical properties that are even remotely plausible candidates for being the properties essentially participate in these patterns of relationships. (McLaughlin 2003: 487)"
