Time to calculate p(doom) given some precesified priors and updated posteriors. 


> Language Agents Reduce the Risk of Existential Catastrophe 1 Simon Goldstein and Cameron Domenico Kirk-Giannini

> 1. Of the following two options, the first will be much more difficult: 
> 	a. Build AGI systems with an acceptably low probability of engaging in power seeking behavior. 
> 	b. Build AGI systems that perform similarly but do not have an acceptably low probability of engaging in power-seeking behavior. 
> 2. Some AGI systems will be exposed to inputs which cause them to engage in power seeking behavior. 
> 3. This power-seeking will scale to the point of permanently disempowering humanity. 
> 4. This disempowerment will constitute an existential catastrophe.


> Carlsmith assigns a probability of .4 to (1) conditional on the rise of AGI, a probability of .65 to (2) conditional on (1) and the rise of AGI, a probability of .4 to (3) conditional on (1), (2), and the rise of AGI, and a probability of .95 to (4) conditional on (1-3) and the rise of AGI. This translates into a probability of approximately .1 (10%) for a misalignment catastrophe conditional on the rise of AGI.
