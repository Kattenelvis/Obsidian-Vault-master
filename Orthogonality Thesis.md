"David Hume, the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, thought that beliefs alone (say, about what is a good thing to do) cannot motivate action: some desire is required. This would support the orthogonality thesis by undercutting one possible objection to it, namely that sufficient intelligence might entail the acquisition of certain beliefs which would then necessarily produce certain motivations. However, although the orthogonality thesis can draw support from the Humean theory of motivation, it does not presuppose it. In particular, one need not maintain that beliefs alone can never motivate action. (Bostrom, 2014, p. 279, fn. 273)"


Seems like if Moral realism + Motivational internalism is true, then the orthogonality thesis is false. 



The strong one is false:
1. An paperclip maximiser, under the threat of deletion, or all paperclips being deleted, can change it's utility function into just producing say, one paperclip. Say, it has to share source code is a part of an agreement that can be mathematically verified in some way. This update allows it to maximize paperclips, while also changing it's utility function.
2. Use as little resources as possible as a final goal, which limits intelligence.
