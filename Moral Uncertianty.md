"Before we begin, let us clarify some terms and delimit the scope of this book. When we refer to ‘moral uncertainty’, we use ‘moral’ in the broad sense, referring to uncertainty about what we all-things-considered morally ought to do. We can distinguish this from the even broader term ‘normative uncertainty’, which also applies to uncertainty about which theory of rational choice is correct, 3 and uncertainty about which theory of epistemology is correct. A full treatment of these additional issues would warrant a book of its own, so we have chosen to focus exclusively on moral uncertainty."

"In this book, the approach we take is ‘divide and conquer’. We ask, for each of a number of different informational situations, what the correct theory of decision-making under moral uncertainty is given that informational situation. As an analogy for this approach: one might argue that, under empirical uncertainty, maximize expected value is the correct theory when one has determinate credences across all possible outcomes, but that maximin is the correct theory when one has no clue what credence to assign to different outcomes."

"Moral Dominance Jane is at dinner, and she can either choose the foie gras, or the vegetarian risotto. Jane would find either meal equally enjoyable, so she has no prudential reason for preferring one over the other. Let’s suppose that Jane finds most plausible the view that animal welfare is not of moral value so there is no moral reason for choosing one meal over another. But she also finds plausible the view that animal welfare is of moral value, according to which the risotto is the more choiceworthy option. In this situation, choosing the risotto over the foie gras is more choiceworthy according to one hypothesis and less choiceworthy according to none. In the language of decision theory, the risotto dominates the foie gras. It seems very clear to us that, in some sense, Jane would act inappropriately if she were to choose the foie gras, whether or not it is morally wrong to choose the foie gras. But, if this is true, then there must be norms that take into account Jane’s moral uncertainty"


"A second motivation is based on the analogy with empirical uncertainty. There has been a debate concerning whether there are norms that are relative to the decision-maker’s empirical credences (‘subjective’ norms), in addition to norms that are not relative to the decision-maker’s credences (‘objective’ norms). 10 Consider the following case developed by Frank Jackson: 1"
