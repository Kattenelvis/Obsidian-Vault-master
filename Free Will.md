Deliberation takes place, two different ways of justifying action a via an axiological system. Different desire is deliberated upon

Yellow circle is performing the action or not with different probabilities

Idea stolen from: [Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/)

The main idea is to avoid luck based theories, a deliberative process is done before an action takes place where the probability of performing the action or not is decided. The desire is determined by a cognitive process using to change one's desire which is considered a free action (indeterministic and timelinesplit caused by deliberation).

Erm, what caused the timesplit?

Alright the blue square needs to be extended back to before the point of divergence.

[A Coherent, Naturalistic, and Plausible Formulation of Libertarian Free Will on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3506245)


One way to charactarize free will: A substance (call it "soul" or whatever) that is a decision agent that causally interacts with matter and/or mind substance in ways that are non-deterministic and non-probabilistic (and also doesn't split the timeline into all arbitrary choices but that's technically a deterministic process). 

One problem with this view might for empiricists be that the justification of such a substance is seemingly impossible with observation. We cannot directly observe this substance. A rationalist might be fine with that. 






Free will might be incompatible with reason, see Plantinga naturalistic argument

Causally bound to say or generate sequences which we call "sound arguments", "valid arguments", "true statements" etc.
