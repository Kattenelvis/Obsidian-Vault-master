### Controversial incentives[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prediction_market&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Controversial incentives")]

Some kinds of prediction markets may create controversial incentives. For example, a market predicting the death of a world leader might be quite useful for those whose activities are strongly related to this leader's policies, but it also might turn into an [assassination market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market "Assassination market").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-33)


### Reputation-based[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prediction_market&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Reputation-based")]

Some prediction websites, sometimes classified as prediction markets, do not involve betting real money but rather add to or subtract from a predictor's [reputation points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_points "Reputation points") based on the accuracy of a prediction. This incentive system may be better-suited than traditional prediction markets for niche or long-timeline questions.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-:1-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-36) These include Manifold Markets,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-37) [Metaculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaculus "Metaculus"), and [Good Judgment Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Judgment_Open "Good Judgment Open").

A 2006 study found that real-money prediction markets were significantly more accurate than play-money prediction markets for non-sports events.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-38)

### Combinatorial prediction markets[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prediction_market&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Combinatorial prediction markets")]

A combinatorial prediction market is a type of prediction market where participants can make bets on combinations of outcomes.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-39) The advantage of making bets on combinations of outcomes is that, in theory, conditional information can be better incorporated into the market price.

One difficulty of combinatorial prediction markets is that the number of possible combinatorial trades scales exponentially with the number of normal trades. For example, a market with merely 100 binary contracts would have 2^100 possible combinations of contracts. These exponentially large data structures can be too large for a computer to keep track of, so there have been efforts to develop algorithms and rules to make the data more tractable.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market#cite_note-41)
