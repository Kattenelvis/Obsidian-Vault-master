Some formal systems are complete but undecidable (such as first order logic, proved by Church)


Diagonalization and constructing an effective procedure $U$ leads to contradictions in some cases 


"> **_  
> Entscheidungsproblem_** The problem to decide for every statement in first-order logic (the so-called restricted functional calculus, see the entry on [classical logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/) for an introduction) whether or not it is derivable in that logic.

Note that in its original form (Hilbert & Ackermann 1928), the problem was stated in terms of validity rather than derivability. Given Gödel’s completeness theorem (Gödel 1929) proving that there is an effective procedure (or not) for derivability is also a solution to the problem in its validity form. In order to tackle this problem, one needs a formalized notion of “effective procedure” and Turing’s machines were intended to do exactly that."


Gödel completeness: $T\vDash \phi \leftrightarrow T\vdash \phi$

Entscheidungsproblem: $\forall\phi PA\vDash\phi$
