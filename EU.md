My opinion on EU federalization:

1. Lean towards pro EU federalism, especially a common defense force separate from NATO and a unified foreign policy to prevent splitting/divide and conquer from external non-EU member states who wants to divide up europe into their own sphere's of influence (USA, Russia, China)
    
2. _[_20:22_]_
    
    Atleast, I'd say it's in most if not all EU member states best interest to federalize
    
3. _[_20:23_]_
    
    On the realist perspective on international relations, an EU state acting in its own interest could perform better than individual states acting in their own interest, minimizing problem of the commons and creating a powerful nation able to resist power domination of other states
    
4. _[_20:24_]_
    
    I'd support a layered federalization, where some members would be lesser members, while some completely federalize, perhaps something similar to the German system (though there are ways of improving this system, hint hint liquid democracy) since the German system allows greater degree of autonomy for its regions. This way, even countries like Canada could be part on the outer sphere on the EU, while others like Belgium becomes no more than what Thüringen is to Germany (ändrad)
    
5. _[_20:27_]_
    
    This doesn't mean the EU is all great or anything, it's too capitalistic, but it would probably be an improvement regardless
