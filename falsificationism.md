Idea: A general proposition $p$ is possibly empirically verifiable and an observation sentence derived from p is false. $p \vdash\neg O$

This does not imply $\neg p$. This would imply several assumption, such as static laws of nature or perfect memory. $P(p)$ may decrease but $P(p) > 0$. Not to mention background hypothesises that may be wrong.
