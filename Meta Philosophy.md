Why do philosophy?

1. It has shifted my mind away from more vague mental-imgary style of thinking and utilizing more of a syntactic structure of thought. 

2. Decreased vagueness in abstract concepts, parsing language has become vastly easier and more clear.

3. Understanding disagreements between people has become vastly easier. Shorter inferential distance between all kinds of people when one has many theories in the head to connect with someone elses world view

4. Figuring out a foundation for scientific inquiry and into which fields are the most important, those being AI alignment, cognition, quantum gravity, consciousness research, climate science and effective organization. 



Idea: The reason philosophy isn't well valued in society is because the stakes are low, risk with being wrong is low, so for risk-averse satisfisers most philosophical propositions aren't as useful - including corporations. 



They have proceeded as if the deliverances of their brute intuitions were not just axiomatic-for-the-sake-of-the-project but true, and, moreover, somehow inviolable … One vivid … sign of this is the curious reversal of the epithet ‘counterintuitive’ among philosophers of mind. In most sciences, there are few things more prized than a counterintuitive result. It shows something surprising and forces us to reconsider our often tacit assumptions. In philosophy of mind a counterintuitive ‘result’ (for example, a mind-boggling implication of somebody’s ‘theory’ of perception, memory, consciousness or whatever) is typically taken as tantamount to a refutation. This affection for one’s current intuitions … installs deep conservatism in the methods of philosophers. (Dennett 2005, 34)



Machery philosophy within its proper bounds:
"nearly every decade of the second half of the twentieth century witnessed intense, multifarious metaphilosophical debates: To allude to only some of these debates, philosophers involved in the linguistic turn extensively debated whether, and in which sense, philosophical questions were linguistic questions; the 1950s and 1960s saw scores of articles pitting the metaphi losophy of ordinary language philosophy against that of Carnap and his followers; the 1960s addressed the concerns raised by Fodor and others against ordinary lan guage philosophy; in the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s philosophers of science debated the role of the history of science in the philosophy of science; the 1970s examined the prospects of reflective equilibrium; the 1980s were in part concerned with the nat uralization of philosophy; the 1990s with mysterianism and with the Canberra plan and its offshoots; the 2000s with the relation between conceivability and possibility and with the significance of experimental philosophy. Dig a bit in a period of phil osophy, and you’ll find some active philosophy of philosophy going on."

"Naturalistic philosophers such as Kornblith, Devitt, and Papineau have often expressed more radical views. Kornblith asserts that “the proper target of philosophical analysis is simply not our concepts” (2014, 207; see also 1998, 133). Papineau pulls no punches (2011, 85): “It is a bad idea to think that any serious philosophy analyses concepts in the first place."


"Ultimately, the disagreement between Carnap and Strawson stems from different views about lay concepts. In line with many ordinary language philosophers (e.g., Austin, 1956), Strawson holds that typically lay concepts fit their functions adequately, and he suggests that philosophical puzzlements result from caricaturing their flexible use. We must describe them as precisely as possible. For Carnap, lay concepts are on the contrary confused, unclear, and vague, and thus of little use for theorizing. We must reform them. My sympathies here mostly lie with Carnap: The conceptual system is full of quirks and kludges, and, while lay concepts may often be as clear as needed for their usual uses, sometimes they let us down when it comes to theorizing or to political action. Reform is then needed, but, as Strawson successfully argues, reform often requires description."


Ordinary Language Philosophy: Conceptual analysis useful for finding out lay-concepts that philosophers are missusing.

Ideal Language Philosophy: Reform concepts with explication to be precice since natural language and lay-concepts are confused and muddy.
