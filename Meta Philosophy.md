Why do philosophy?

1. It has shifted my mind away from more vague mental-imgary style of thinking and utilizing more of a syntactic structure of thought. 

2. Decreased vagueness in abstract concepts, parsing language has become vastly easier and more clear.

3. Understanding disagreements between people has become vastly easier. Shorter inferential distance between all kinds of people when one has many theories in the head to connect with someone elses world view

4. Figuring out a foundation for scientific inquiry and into which fields are the most important, those being AI alignment, cognition, quantum gravity, consciousness research, climate science and effective organization. 



Idea: The reason philosophy isn't well valued in society is because the stakes are low, risk with being wrong is low, so for risk-averse satisfisers most philosophical propositions aren't as useful - including corporations. 



They have proceeded as if the deliverances of their brute intuitions were not just axiomatic-for-the-sake-of-the-project but true, and, moreover, somehow inviolable … One vivid … sign of this is the curious reversal of the epithet ‘counterintuitive’ among philosophers of mind. In most sciences, there are few things more prized than a counterintuitive result. It shows something surprising and forces us to reconsider our often tacit assumptions. In philosophy of mind a counterintuitive ‘result’ (for example, a mind-boggling implication of somebody’s ‘theory’ of perception, memory, consciousness or whatever) is typically taken as tantamount to a refutation. This affection for one’s current intuitions … installs deep conservatism in the methods of philosophers. (Dennett 2005, 34)
