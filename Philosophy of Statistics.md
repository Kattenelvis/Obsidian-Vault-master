In philosophy of statistics, [computationalism implies Bayesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference) (instead of cringe frequentism). A good book might be The Equation of Knowledge by Lê Nguyên Hoang but I haven't read it yet.



Bayesian: Two fixed bounds where the parameters are random variable.

Inferential: Two random bounds where the parameters are fixed variables. 

Bayesian intervals treat their bounds as fixed and the estimated parameter as a random variable, whereas frequentist confidence intervals treat their bounds as random variables and the parameter as a fixed value.

The Self Sampling Assumption (SSA) states that **we should reason as if we're a random sample from the set of actual existent observers**, while the self indication assumption (SIA) states that we should reason as if we're a random sample from among the set of all possible observers (see [1]).
