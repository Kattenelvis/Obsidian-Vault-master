Here's my utilitarian argument: 1. We should strive to maximise happiness, and prioritize happiness for the people with the least happiness (utilitarianism with the egalitarian rule) (ethical premise). 2. Trans people are generally happier with transition, low levels of regret rates. Regret correlates with negative utility (empirical premise). 3. Trans people before transition and especially those with an unaccepting family have higher levels of anxiety, depression and suicide rates than people in general. (empirical premise) 4. (2) implies that happiness is increased when transition is legal and easy and accepted by family members and others, which by ethical proposition (1) implies that we should do these things. Since (3) shows that they have lower degrees of happiness than the average person, they should be atleast somewhat prioritized (given egalitarian rule utilitarianism). Research should be pursued to minimise regret rates. (conclusion) 5. Transitioning, which increases happiness, includes a social transition that includes being called a "woman" or a "man" because those words, being social pragmatic words in everyday contexts, are determined by their word usage rather than anything metaphysical like the "form of woman" or other platonic crap.

Sure but I could ask then, how should we treat transwomen as women, and trans men as men. In this case the questions touches other aspects like the construction of gender, the validity of your subjective experience or will when you manifest that, if you need GD in order to be trans, if we can all be trans then would it become a meaningless category etc.?"

These are all good questions. I think that the phenomenal experience of gender identity X, like mental states when referred as gender X, look like X, or affirms themselves as X, is what the term "gender X" in "I identify as gender X" refers too. If the subject experiencing gender X can form reliable beliefs on their phenomenal experience then they are X (note that I said "are X" and not "considered by society as X", which means this is ontological and not ethical. Excluding when a person has unreliable belief formation such as during schizophrenia or psychosis, but not dissociative identity disorder or autism). Gender dysphoria would mean that the phenomenal experience of being referred as gender not X, look like not X, or affirms themselves as not X, correlates with negative happiness. Gender euphoria is associated positive happiness with being referred to as gender X e.t.c. Both are phenomenal experiences about X, and dysphoria is not needed. Heck, even a neutral state is possible. Even if a subject has phenomenal experience about X that correlates with neutral emotions about being referred to as male, positive as female, choosing to transition could still be the optimal decision.




Interesting ethical dilemma:
