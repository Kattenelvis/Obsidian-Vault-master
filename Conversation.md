> I come in at 22 on the Wired test.

I have a weird story about me and living with people-- I've never heard of anything else like it, but this crowd is as likely a place as any to see if someone else has experienced or heard of something similar.

Up into adulthood, I was moderately bad at social interaction, and also not interested in "that boring people stuff". When Asperger's came on the public radar, I wondered if I had it (I'm 57-- if I'd been born later, there might have been an effort at diagnosis and treatment, but as it was, I was simply the sort of person who deserved to be bullied), but the emotional tone for people with Asperger's seemed to be that they tried to be social, couldn't make it work, and were sad about it. I was angry, and I hadn't tried especially hard, either. I was inclined to think I had a combination of being naturally somewhat socially inept and having grown up in an emotionally abusive family.

Anyway, sometime in my 30s (I don't have the autistic thing about dates), I was at an Alexander Technique workshop led by [Tommy Thompson](http://easeofbeing.com/) who has a background in meditation, and he had the class pair off and pay attention to each other for what was probably one or two minutes. That was when I found out that I'd had a lifelong pattern of my attention skidding away quickly whenever I was faced with a human being, and it didn't have to be like that.

It didn't feel as though I was learning not to have a bad habit, it felt like a developmental stage I'd missed. Being able to notice and pay attention to people as having long term patterns was an instant and permanent change for me, including that I came into much better focus for myself and that I was more interested in fictional characters.

I overestimated how complete the change was, and therapy at that time probably would have been a very good idea, but I've gradually become more social-- to the point where I can actually enjoy (reasonably intelligent) mundane conversation for an hour or two at a time, though I do start to get lack-of-abstraction claustrophobia after a while. I'm going to see if there's some way to get people out of the highly concrete chitchat vortex. (I recently spent a couple of hours with [computer word game social group](http://www.playbabble.com/), and only found out afterwards that one of them was pacifist lawyer who works with conscientious objectors and is very glad to talk about it-- would have been much more interesting that the conversation I was in.)

Aside from my particular story, I'm beginning to wonder if a lot of what seems like innate incompetence (being bad at math for example) is that sort of correctable attentional skid.


I love the terms "lack-of-abstraction claustrophobia" and "highly concrete chitchat vortex." You have a way with words.
