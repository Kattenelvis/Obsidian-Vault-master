## Relation to the Deontic


"One of the biggest and most important questions about value is the matter of its relation to the deontic — to categories like _right_, _reason_, _rational_, _just_, and _ought_. According to _teleological_ views, of which classical consequentialism and universalizable egoism are classic examples, deontic categories are posterior to and to be explained in terms of evaluative categories like _good_ and _good for_."

"Teleological theories are not, strictly speaking, theories about value. They are theories about right action, or about what one ought to do." Basically, teleological theories have claims about goodness as premisses and deontic claims as conclusions. 

"The most familiar sort of view falling under this umbrella is _classical consequentialism_, sometimes called (for reasons we’ll see in section 3.3) “agent-neutral consequentialism”. According to classical consequentialism, every agent ought always to do whatever action, out of all of the actions available to her at that time, is the one such that if she did it, things would be best."
"Classical consequentialism is sometimes supported by appeal to the intuition that one should always do the best action, and then the assumption that actions are only instrumentally good or bad — for the sake of what they lead to"

"The problem with this reasoning is that non-consequentialists can agree that agents ought always to do the best action. The important feature of this claim to recognize is that it is a claim not about intrinsic or instrumental value, but about attributive good. [...] Just as how good of a can opener something is or how good of a torturer someone is does not depend on how good the world is, as a result of the fact that they exist, how good of an action something is need not depend on how good the world is, as a result that it happens. Indeed, if it did, then the evaluative standards governing actions would be quite different from those governing nearly everything else."

Two other teleological theories are:
- Universalizable Egoism, which is very similar to Utilitarianism.
- Natural law theories, which posit a set of natural values which agents ought to act in accordance too. 


Fitting attidues theories however, do the opposite of teleological one's in that the deontic operators of Just, Ought, Rational e.t.c is prior and explains what is good instead.
