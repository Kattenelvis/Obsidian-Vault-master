> According to Markov (2014) there are various physical bounds on, for example, a finite maximum computational speed, and perhaps every aspect of the physical universe is finite and bounded. Some could argue that we could still imagine infinites in other possible worlds, but what if we can not really imagine it or if there are no such possible worlds?


Kan vara värt att nämna closed timelike-curves och hur dom kanske kan enabla hyperdatorer. 



> In this section previous studies and the contribution of this thesis to the field of research is described, as well as some important objections to ultrafinitism.

Är den här meningen viktig?


> With that clarification of what might otherwise lead to confusion stated, the overview of the previous studies begins with an historical overview.


Lite halv-awkwardly skrivet. Kanske bättre:

This clarification is important to prevent confusion. 

The overview of the previous studies begins with an historical overview.


> 𝑇𝑎 is a set that is a subset of the set of theorems


T_a is a subset of the set of theorems


> Whenever quantifiers only range over finite sets then expressions with quantifiers can be replaced by quantifier-free expressions (according to some non-ultrafinitist mathematics)


within some systems of non-ultrafinitist logic?



> Whenever quantifiers only range over finite sets then expressions with quantifiers can be replaced by quantifier-free expressions (according to some non-ultrafinitist mathematics) (Troelstra, 2011, pp.151-152). Further every quantifier is bounded. This means that the notion of proof-theoretic strength in the arithmetical hierarchy, a hierarchy determining proof-theoretic strength, for every expression in the formal language is the weakest possible (Dzhaparidze, 1994).


Båda eller bara att den är bunden?



> This means that generically for ultrafinite formal system the undefinability of truth is the case.

Varför? Det är väl inte sufficient arithmetic, precis som i ofullständighets-fallet?



> $\forall t (f_e : S_E \to S_E)$ 

Är $\forall t$ onödigt?




> There are also arguments against certain forms of phenomenalism, one example of such an argument is using what is called “Truthmaker theory”. Truthmaker theory is about what makes something true, however there is no consensus on what needs truthmakers and there are arguments against that it rules out certain forms of phenomenalism (MacBride & Daly, 2013).


Varför menar vissa att truthmakers implicerar att fenomenalism är falskt?
