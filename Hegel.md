< Idea>: Platonic dialectics is good enough. Formalizable in dialogical logic.

There are empirical consequences to Hegel being right. We'd expect a construction of machines utilizing paraconsistent logic at being better than machines using classical logic at a large range of tasks including perception, memory, movement, manipulation of objects, world-knowledge and logical reasoning. Otherwise, contradictions in reasoning is dispensible.

Hegel hypothesized that self-consciousness came through analysing other people and applying it on ourselves, which is true.



1.  1. Phosophy cannot start with a historical preface, even the preface of a philosophical work should be philosophical itself, lest it be a redundancy. 2. The atoms or components of truth are concepts; concepts are what bear truth. And the best method of developing truth is science, especially a science which develops alongside the empirical world. 3. Faculties are bad explainations. And formalism is cringe. Very cringe. 4. The absolute is the subject of all things, by its nature. 5. Science flourishes upon universality, and in its transport into various domains of "the self." As it progresses through life. 6. The historical and critical development of forms as they respond to phenomena is phenomenogy; the reason why formalism is cringe. Why "rules for rules," is cringe. 7. Concepts are suicidal. They always end themselves, and we find new ones, for better or for worse. 8. Truth can be "good," or "bad," depending on who or what is asking 9. There is no.form of truth, only content is true 10. Truth is an emergent property in history. But immediately, it is everywhere 11. Consciousness finds itself in mirrors in the world -- this is the best way to learning 12. Both genius and common sense can be untrue in their entirety 13. Our Natural thought processes are caused by anxieties, which emerge mostly in this age as "instruments of reason," which taint true knowledge. 14. All forms are founded in nothing, including the tools, which extend this nothingness into the future, as a kind of desire for nothing. 15. These tools are either active or passive. 16. If the tools are attempted to be removed. We get sterile knowledge. Not pure knowledge. 17. Stop fearing failure, every thought, even if it sucks, is still a comtribution to the development of thought. 18. Science progresses, it cannot be found immediately. 19. Science develops through questioning the natural world 20. Consciousness is nervous of the inquisitiveness of scienc

    e because this challenges the completeness od consciousness

    21. Kant, Locke, Descartes, and Frege are all cringe

    22. Representation is what our natural thought processes do, and these representations change the development of our natural thought patterns.

    23. Natural consciousness eventually finds itself to be wrong. But once it does, it has already outgrown itself.
    
6.  _[_13:57_]_
    
    24. The motor of natural consciousness is its desire for a science.
    
7.  _[_13:58_]_
    
    25. Connsciousness, in its natural state, is scared of failure, and compares itself to itself

    26. Science is the limit of our natural thought processes. Science is the knowledge which can actually critique itself without destroying itself.

Immanent Critique is the application of the dialectics (the logical part of Hegel's system) to historical processes. 




Mind-Fusion: The mereological fusion of all minds is what Hegel calls the Geist. As the Geist holds contradictory beliefs, it resolves those contradictions through philosophical reasoning and natural science. Reaching a higher level of self-understanding as more of these contradictions are resolved, until complete full self-understanding.
