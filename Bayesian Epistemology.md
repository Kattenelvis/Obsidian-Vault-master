Underdetermination as explained by Bayesian confirmation theory: Underdetermination 

$p(h|e)$
Confirmation whenever new evidence $e^*$ comes in
$p(h|e,e^*) > p(h|e)$
And disconfirmation if it's $<$. If the evidence is $=$, then once can exclude that evidence updating.

Problem (Rosenberg & McIntyre chapter 10): If $h$ is the hypothesis that Andy is pregnant, $e$ evidence that he's eating cereal for breakfast, and $b$ evidence that Andy is a guy, then
$p(h|e) > p(h|e\wedge b)$ and $p(h|b) = p(h|e\wedge b)$  
Yet cereal still seems "irrelevant".

The sentences that make up evidence already uses the language of ordinary objects. Apparently that's a auxiliarry hypothesis/assupmtion. 

“the paradox of confirmation.”
"For logic tells us that “All As are Bs” if and only if “All non-Bs are non-As.” To see this, consider what would be an exception to “All As are Bs.” It would be an A that was not a B. But this would also be the only exception to “All non-Bs are non-As.” Accordingly, statements of these two forms are logically equivalent. In consequence, all swans are white if and only if all non-white things are non-swans. The two sentences are logically equivalent formulations of the same statement. Since the black boot is a non-white non-swan, it is a positive instance of the hypothesis that all non-white things are non-swans, a.k.a. all swans are white. The black boot is a positive instance of the hypothesis that all swans are white. To many it will seem as though something has gone seriously wrong here! Surely the way to assess a hypothesis about swans is not to examine boots!"

"The literature offers several broadly Bayesian frameworks for modeling eradication of certainties. The framework I myself favor uses regular conditional distributions (rcds) to generalize the ratio formula, thereby delineating conditional probabilities P(H | E) for numerous cases where P(E) = 0"

"Following Armendt (1993) and Skyrms (1987a), I respond that we may construe payoffs as utilities rather than monetary amounts. An agent who maximizes expected utility should be willing to accept the bets comprising the non-factive diachronic Dutch book, with payoffs construed as utilities."
