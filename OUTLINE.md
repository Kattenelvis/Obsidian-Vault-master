Goal: Make each chapter a separate blog post, work, iterate, a few years later I should have a book out. Finish the philosophy book first (most likely). 


Potential title: An opiniated introduction to the philosophy of AI.

Potential title: The philosophy of AI from a transhumanist and AI safety perspective.

Introduction: Why Alignment is important

Chapter 1: Technical background (Mathematics needed for the book)

AI safety outline

Interpretability

Language model alignment

Truth-maximiser and whether or not a happiness-maximiser would also need to be a truth-maximiser (convergent instrumental goals). 


Singular Learning theory
[[Singular Learning Theory]]

Satisfisers AI that doesn't try to hard.
	They have an easy time becoming maximisers though due to gaining more utility by increasing it's credence that it is satisficing. 



Models such as NARS, gödel machines, AIXI


Corrigibility


AI research converging upon the transformer architecture [Transformer (machine learning model) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))
