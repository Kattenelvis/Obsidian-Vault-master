Just like what Boström discussess in "Superintelligence", there is a problem that even if we manage to create an AGI whereby we solve the control problem, there still remains the problem of which values it should be acting on. This is equivalent to solving ethics.

Could [[Deontic Logic]] solve this problem?

$◻p=\neg◇\neg p$

The SU Doctors thesis: hyperintentional DL
