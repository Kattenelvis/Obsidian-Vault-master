1. Joint Attention
2. Shared intention
3. Collective Acceptance
4. Collective Emotion


The central problem:
1. **The Irreducibility Claim**: Collective intentionality is no simple summation, aggregate, or distributive pattern of individual intentionality.
2. **The Individual Ownership Claim**: Collective intentionality is had by the participating individuals, and all the intentionality an individual has is their own.




mutual belief and common knowledge not sufficient for collective intention.

If two agents intend $\alpha$
$I_a\alpha\wedge I_b\alpha$

Does not intend the group intends $\alpha$
$I_A\alpha$
where $A=\{a,b\}$

Even when combined with
$B_a I_b(\alpha)$

And so on for common knowledge between $A$ and $B$.

$CK_A(I_a\alpha)\wedge CK_A(I_b\alpha)$


Thought: Daniel Dennetts intentional stance can be adapted to groups. If they seem to have belief, desire and intentional states then we can model and predict their actions as if they have those states. 


Dennet and Clark extended cognition: Are minds extended into eachother? If so, how much would that play a role in collective intentions and desires (preference relations)? 

"In such situations, fully rational agents choose their preferred course of action on the basis of what they cognitively expect other agents to do. However, Weber is well aware of the fact that where dependence of each participant’s choice on his or her expectation concerning the other’s behavior is out in the open, the situation becomes unstable. In addressing this issue, Weber discusses the case in which people act on the assumption of being _in agreement_ with other agents, which then enables them to have _normative_ expectations concerning each other’s behavior. This is a decisive step beyond what has later become known as rational choice theory. Such agents do not choose according to what they think to be best given what they think others are likely to do; rather, they rely on others to do what they _ought_ to do"

"Weber’s conception thus foreshadows the neglect of collective intentions and actions in later rational choice and game theory."

Just....have groups as agents? Guess that doesn't quite work, if we're trying to study human behavior.

"(Quasi-)Durkheim’s and Weber’s conceptions mark the Scylla and the Charybdis of the debate. The Scylla is a straightforward anti-reductivism about collective intentionality that comes at the cost of a flat-out rejection of individual intentional autonomy. The Charybdis is a reductionist attempt that denies collective intentionality for rational social agents."




Walther claims that for _A_ and _B_ to share the experience of _x_, 

i) _A_ has to experience _x_, and _B_ has to experience _x_, 
ii) _A_ has to empathize with _B_’s experience and vice versa, 
iii) _A_ has to identify with _B_’s experience and vice versa, and 
iv) there has to be mutual empathetic awareness of the other’s identification (Walther 1923: 85f.).

Idea: Since x is not sense data (unless they so happen to share sense data) then x (for A) and x (for B) are most likely different. We denote with $x_A$ and $x_B$. They must are similar enough. Beetle in the box situation?

"Walther offers substantive analyses of empathetic experience and identification, but the question remains why the reciprocal intentional attitudes required from the participants in shared experience stops at level three (current accounts that follow similar lines usually require full common knowledge)."

No common knowledge!??



## What is collective about collective intentionaliy?

A common starting point of the theory of intentionality can be rendered as follows: 

(1) intentionality is taken to be a feature of minds,
(2) minds are to be conceived as individual minds (or minds of individuals), and 
(3) each individual has his or her _own_ mind.



$M_a(p)$

The $M$ is the mode, such as intend, fear, desire, belive etc. 
$a$ is the subject holding the attitude
$p$ is the content. Propositions or actions (or questions?).



Reductionism: Reducing "We" statements into many "I statements". "We, A,B and C, intend J" can be reduced to something like "I, A, intend J" and "I, B intend J" and "I, C, intend J" and sentences connecting A and B. "I, A, intend J with B",..., "I, A, intend to J with B and C",...


**Methodological Individualism:**"But the general requirements of what is sometimes called ‘‘methodological individualism’’ do not require that we-intentions be redu cible to I-intentions, because the requirement that all intentionality exist in individual brains does not imply that the content that exists in the individual brains cannot exist in a plural grammatical form. If we are cleaning the yard together, then in my head I have the thought, ‘‘We are cleaning the yard’’ and in your head you have the thought, ‘‘We are cleaning the yard.’’"
