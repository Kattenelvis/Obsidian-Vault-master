Why does epistemic logic (before Hintikka's fix) imply logical omniscience? That is to say, $K_i((p)\wedge (p\rightarrow q))\rightarrow K_i(q)$ . Epistemic closure? Similar to AGM updating? 

Also, think about why Hintikka's introduction of impossible/contradictory worlds fixes this problem. Or Rantala's seemingly possible worlds. Or dividing between implicit and explicit knowledge.
