In the [[Philosophy of Mathematics]], infinite has for a long time been a large topic.

Two types of potential infinity:

Modulo 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 

Successor
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> ... -> n -> n + 1

Actual infinity
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...

"An intermediate position is that defended by classical “predicativists” such as Poincaré and Weyl. The theory, presented in a satisfactory logical way by Feferman and others, accepts the excluded middle on the natural numbers (and as such it is arguably committed to the existence of the set of natural numbers and in any case to accepting bivalence on the natural numbers) but does not accept the existence of the power set of the natural numbers. According to _predicativism_ (see Feferman 2005), sets exist only if they are definable in some non-circular linguistic way. In accepting the excluded middle on the natural numbers and in making the existence of sets depend on our definitional abilities, this position is a sort of a compromise between a classical and a constructive viewpoint. In 1918, Hermann Weyl (Weyl 1918; see Kaufmann 1930 for a related program) presented the foundations of analysis within this framework and showed that a great part of classical analysis can be carried out within the framework by replacing talk of arbitrary sets of real numbers with arithmetical sequences of real numbers. Feferman 1988 gave a detailed formal presentation of the theory and proved that, on a certain reconstruction, the theory is a conservative extension of Peano Arithmetic. In addition, he also used the theory to state an important conjecture concerning how much mathematics is needed in physics. In Feferman 1984 and 1987, he proposed that all of mathematics used in physical theory can be recaptured in a predicative system of analysis. Using the metatheoretical result of conservativity mentioned above, he also exploited the argument to claim that Quine and Putnam’s indispensability arguments (see the entry on [indispensability arguments in philosophy of mathematics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathphil-indis/)) at best commit us to what Peano Arithmetic commits us to."


"A consequence of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems is that under the assumption that $PA$ is consistent one can find a finitistic statement such that neither it nor its negation is provable from Peano Arithmetic. Gödel showed, through subtle coding of metamathematical notions in the language of arithmetic, how to express in the language of arithmetic a formula $G$ that “says” of itself that it is not provable. One can also ascertain that the formula is true on the natural numbers. Since all the finitary reasoning is assumed to be included in $PA$, establishing the truth of the Gödel sentence and of the new incompleteness results requires appeal to some “infinitary” principles (when the truth of the Gödel sentence $G$ is established through appeal to the statement expressing the consistency of $PA$, it is establishing the latter that requires some portion of infinitary reasoning, such as induction up to an infinite ordinal called $ε_0$).

The situation is the same for the statement $Con(PA)$ expressing the consistency of $PA$. Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem shows that neither it nor its negation can be proved from PA but an appeal to some infinitary reasoning shows it to hold in the natural numbers. While perfectly fine for the logician’s need and central to the evaluation of Hilbert’s program, Gödel’s sentences appear concocted from the point of view of the practicing mathematician. Within Hilbert’s program statements of PA expressible either without quantifiers or with a string of universal quantifiers followed by a non-quantificational formula count as finitistic statements. The statements $G$ and $Con(PA)$ mentioned above also belong to this class. Finitistic statements with obvious mathematical relevance include basic properties such as the commutativity of addition as well as the statement of Fermat’s last theorem (whose proof has been established using higher mathematics but logicians are convinced that it can also be carried out in $PA$). Logicians have not been able to find finitistic statements with obvious mathematical significance that require a detour through the infinite, but they have been able to do the next best thing. They have found statements that have the form $(∀x)(∃y)A(x,y)$, which express a certain functional connection between numbers and have shown that such statements, although true, cannot be proved using only the resources of $PA$. Among the most famous such results are a modification of Ramsey’s finite theorem provided by Paris and Harrington (1977), and the proof that a theorem by Goodstein (1944) cannot be proved in $PA$ (Kirby and Paris 1982). There are stronger results that are independent of even stronger systems that are studied within the context of reverse mathematics (e.g., Kruskal’s theorem is independent of predicative analysis—see Simpson 1985, 2002)."
