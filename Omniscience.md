"Hartshorne develops this idea by making distinctions between kinds of knowledge and kinds of power. Some things that human beings know are known immediately, by “vivid and direct intuition”, while other things are known only indirectly or through inference. Hartshorne holds that the former kind of knowledge is infallible, and it is the kind of knowledge human beings have of their own thoughts and feelings. Since this kind of knowledge is the highest form of knowledge, it is the kind God has, and he has it with respect to the entire cosmos."

My comment: Logical deductions can be infallible by a perfectly rational actor, and can as such have an axiomatic base with the necessary conditions for said axiomatic base and infallible inference system such that every belief is justified and thus knowledge. 



The intension of the set of all knowledge is 
$\{\phi | K(\phi)\}$

Given some set of criteria for knowledge, like JTB:
$\{\phi | J(\phi)\wedge\phi\wedge B(\phi)\}$

Causal:
$\{\phi | J(\phi)\wedge\phi\wedge B(\phi)\wedge \}$

Reliabilist:
$\{\phi | J(\phi)\wedge\phi\wedge B(\phi)\}$


Only one omniscient being since simulating a mind entirely requires having that mind as a subset and knowledge about experience. 

Polytheistic Omniscience: The union of the belief sets of all gods is equal to the set of all knowledge.
