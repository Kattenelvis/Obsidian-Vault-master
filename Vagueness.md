"It is impossible to summarize all analysis of vagueness in the literature, so I will focus here on an overview of four major approaches, based on supervaluations, epistemic uncertainty, contextualism, and interest relativity."


The crucial components of Fine’s theory are stated in (37)-(39); a similar set of proposals (and a more comprehensive linguistic analysis) can be found in Kamp (1975) and especially Klein (1980). 

(37) Specification space  A partially ordered set of points corresponding to different ways of specifying the predicates in the language; at each point, every proposition is assigned true, false or nothing according to an “intuitive” valuation. This valuation must obey certain crucial constraints, such as Fine’s Penumbral Connections which ensure e.g., that if x is taller than y, it can never be the case that x is tall is false while y is tall is true (cf. the Consistency Postulate of Klein 1980).

(38) Completability 720 Any point can be extended to a point at which every proposition is assigned 721 a truth value, subject to the following constraints: 722 a. FIDELITY: Truth values at complete points are 1 or 0.
b. STABILITY: Definite truth values are preserved under extension. 

(39) Supertruth 725 A proposition is supertrue (or superfalse) at a partial specification iff it is 726 true (false) at all complete extensions.
