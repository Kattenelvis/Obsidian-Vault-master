[(61) Moral Realism: The Arbitrariness Challenge - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWkcAwlql0s)
It is arbitrary to some objective value X no matter it's source (society, God e.t.c) and there's no reason to follow it over subjective value Y.


"2. First, one needs to get clear on what they mean by "realism". We could take this to be a metaphysical thesis. Realism posits the existence of moral entities, say, or perhaps realism is the view that there are truths about morality and such truths are independent of us (these are distinct theses). The answer to your question is also dependent on whether you want to read the contemporary literature or if you want something historical, as these kinds of issues have been dealt with for thousands of years. To begin with lets just assume you mean realism is a metaphysical thesis and you want the contemporary literature, as I assume this is probably close to what you are looking for. The main split between realisms in this sense is between naturalists and non-naturalists; those who think moral properties are in some sense reducible to natural properties and those who think they are irreducible. Those representing the former camp would be: Peter Railton who has a well known paper called _Moral Realism_ [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2185589](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2185589 "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2185589"), and has a book called "Facts, Values, and Norms" which has several other papers on metaethics. Richard Boyd who has a paper called "How to Be a Moral Realist" [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240034001_How_to_Be_a_Moral_Realist](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240034001_How_to_Be_a_Moral_Realist "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240034001_How_to_Be_a_Moral_Realist") David O. Brink who has a well known book called "Moral Realism and the Foundations of Ethics" and many papers on metaethics usually harkening back to the writings of historical figures such as Sidgwick, T.H. Greene, and Bradley. I would suggest looking through his published articles and seeing what looks interesting [https://philpeople.org/profiles/david-brink](https://philpeople.org/profiles/david-brink "https://philpeople.org/profiles/david-brink"). Mark Schroeder wrote a book called "Slaves of the Passions" and has a well known paper called "Realism and Reduction: the Quest for Robustness" [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/phimp/3521354.0005.001/1](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/phimp/3521354.0005.001/1 "https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/phimp/3521354.0005.001/1") Frank Jackson and Phillip Pettit have a well known paper called "Moral Functionalism and Moral Motivation" [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2219846](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2219846 "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2219846") and Jackson has a well known book called "From Metaphysics to Ethics" where he deals with metaethics in a broader program. There are other philosophers who take an Aristotelean approach to ethics who are often called moral naturalists. These would be people like: John McDowell has several papers on the issue of naturalism in ethics. The fourth section from Mind and World deals with this [https://teoriadelconocimientocontemporanea.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/mcdowell-mind-and-world.pdf](https://teoriadelconocimientocontemporanea.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/mcdowell-mind-and-world.pdf "https://teoriadelconocimientocontemporanea.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/mcdowell-mind-and-world.pdf"), he has a paper called "Two Sorts of Naturalism", "Values and Secondary Qualities", and many others in section 2 of his book "Mind, Value, and Reality" [https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS338/John%20McDowell_Mind%2C%20Value%2C%20and%20Reality.pdf](https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS338/John%20McDowell_Mind%2C%20Value%2C%20and%20Reality.pdf "https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS338/John%20McDowell_Mind%2C%20Value%2C%20and%20Reality.pdf") Philippa Foot who wrote a well known book called "Natural Goodness", and has several volumes of collected essays on these issues such as "Virtues and Vices: And Other Essays in Moral Philosophy" Elizabeth Anscombe who wrote a well known paper called "Modern Moral Philosophy" [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3749051](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3749051 "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3749051"), and has several collections of essays on these issues such as "Human Life, Action and Ethics". Iris Murdoch who wrote the well known book "The Sovereignty of Good" as well as several others such as "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals". The non-naturalists are typically taken to be represented best by: G.E. Moore who wrote the locus classicus of contemporary metaethics "Principia Ethica" W.D. Ross who wrote a well known book called "The Right and the Good" David Enoch who wrote a well known book called "Taking Morality Seriously: A Defense of Robust Realism" Russ Shafer-Landau who wrote a well known book called "Moral Realism: A Defense" Terence Cuneo who wrote a book called "The Normative Web" Michael Huemer who wrote a well known book called "Ethical Intuitionism" Robert Audi who wrote a book called "Moral Perception" This is surely not an exhaustive list of the contemporary literature, but its a pretty good overview I think
