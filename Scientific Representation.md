Representations of atoms, bridges, chemicals e.t.c. How do they work?

Atleast five different problems of scientific representation.

The first problem:

Idea: Given Clarks and Chalmer's theory of extended cognition, the scientific representations can be a part of the individuals cognitive system and is as such a mental representation as well. Now I'm about to go crazy. Multiple individuals can share a scientific representation as part of their mental representations, and all such users could form a single cognitive system. This entire cognitive system could be an entire group of researchers, forming a collective intelligence with collective intentionality (but not collective consciousness, probably). This might be extended to society as a whole, since they're likely using the internet and other things in a very large cognitive system. 

Something about indexical- and lexicographic representations

Second Problem: Demarkation problem between scientific and non-scientific representations.

Third Problem:

Problem of style: How many different kinds of scientific representations are there.

Standards of accuracy: What makes a representation accurate.

Possibility of missrepresentation

Like mental representations, they need a target in the world. So there is the problem of directionality (intentionality? But I like the word directionality better). Phlogestelon, Aether and 4-sex propulations don't exist but we have models of them. 

Because of the unexplained usefulness of mathematics, _Applicability of Mathematics Condition_

"  
In answering the above questions one invariably runs up against a further problem, theÂ _Problem of Ontology_: what kinds of objects are representations?"
