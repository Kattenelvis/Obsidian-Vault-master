Hume: No, we can only learn from sense impression, impressions of similar sense perceptions does not imply any kind of natural laws. The problem of induction, and doing the same thing over and over again, never lets us draw the inference that inductive reasoning can lend us to knowability of natural laws nor causality.

Kant: Causality is a way we structure the manifold of experience, as causality is a category of the mind. Our knowledge about causality can as such be synthetic a priori, between the understanding and sense experience.

Mill: Actually no.

Carnap: Causality can never be verified, since it requires an infinite number of observation sentences to justify. 

Popper: Statements about causality can be considered true if they're falsifiable, until they are falsified. 

Contemporary analytic philosophy (Bayesian Probability): Causality is an internal actor model which updates probabilities internally as new sense datum comes in. Bayesian nets formalise a larger system of correlations.

Contemporary analytic philosophy (Inferentialist statistics): Correlations can justify causation given that the null hypothesis of causation not being the case can be ruled out statistically. 

Contemporary analytic philosophy (Counterfactuals): Causality is counterfactuals on possible worlds or split timelines. 

Contemporary analytic philosophy (Causal logic): Causality is a set of logical systems science can use in their theories.

Contemporary analytic philosophy (Scientific Realism): Causality existing depends on what our best scientific theories need to explain observations. Causality is abductively justified. Retrocausality (causality backwards in time) for example, might exist in certain theories about quantum field theory.



I wouldn't call myself a causal sceptic, it probably exists. However I do think that it's rational to suspend judgment over what exactly causality is, it's properties, and to what extend the cosmological argument is sound. This is because

1. Humean criticisms of causality shows that there is an epistemic gap to ever knowing that A causes B. If we take causality to involve necessity, then we can never completely verify that A causes B with a finite number of observations.

2. The large number of causal models that have been developed over recent decades, such as the counterfactual theory, manipulability theories and probabilistic theories are all different, and as far as I can tell (though I might be wrong) incompatible i.e the conjunction of any two of them implies a contradiction.

3. Uncaused events are not as strange as sometimes assumed. All it states is that p is true at time T, and that there is no proposition q true at T - 1 such that q caused p (assuming discrete time). I know you're a spinozist and likely believe the principle of sufficient reason is true, but I fail to see why the PSR is true. If the PSR is false, then that makes most (if not all) cosmological arguments unsound.

4. Taking causality to be some kind of inference to best explanation for the existence of inductive reasoning, first implies inductive reasoning can be shown true, which again has problems with the humean problem of induction. It cannot be proven logically to be true always, since it's negation doesn't imply a contradiction, and using induction for induction is viciously circular (well induction has worked so far!). I'm unsure, but the raven paradox and the new problem of induction might complicate things even more. It also assumes inference to the best explanation works in philosophy, which empiricists generally deny.

5. A certain interpretation of quantum mechanics called retrocausality might make things even more complicated. One assumption in Bell's theorem is that causality is uni-directional. But since Bell's theorem is empirically false, one assumption must be wrong. Retrocausalists believe it to be the uni-directionality of causality. It will be interesting to see how this will work out.
