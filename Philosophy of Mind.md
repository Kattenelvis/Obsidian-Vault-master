Abstract:

> Recent years have seen a blossoming of theories about the biological and physical basis of consciousness. Good theories guide empirical research, allowing us to interpret data, develop new experimental techniques and expand our capacity to manipulate the phenomenon of interest. Indeed, it is only when couched in terms of a theory that empirical discoveries can ultimately deliver a satisfying understanding of a phenomenon. However, in the case of consciousness, it is unclear how current theories relate to each other, or whether they can be empirically distinguished. To clarify this complicated landscape, we review **four prominent theoretical approaches to consciousness: higher- order theories, global workspace theories, reentry and predictive processing theories and integrated information theory.** We describe the key characteristics of each approach by identifying which aspects of consciousness they propose to explain, what their neurobiological commitments are and what empirical data are adduced in their support. We consider how some prominent empirical debates might distinguish among these theories, and we outline three ways in which theories need to be developed to deliver a mature regimen of theory testing in the neuroscience of consciousness. There are good reasons to think that the iterative development, testing and comparison of theories of consciousness will lead to a deeper understanding of this most profound of mysteries.

```
* Embodied: Cognition cannot be fully described in terms of abstract mental processes (i.e., in terms of representations). Rather, it must involve the entire body of the living system (brain and body).
* Embedded: Cognition is not an isolated event separated from the agent’s ecological niche. Instead, it displays layers of co-determination with physical, social, and cultural aspects of the world.
* Extended: Cognition is often offloaded into biological beings and non-biological devices to serve a variety of functions that would be impossible (or too difficult) to be achieved by only relying on the agent’s own mental processes.
* Enactive: Cognition is conceived of as the set of meaningful relationships determined by an adaptive two-way exchange between the biological and phenomenological complexity of living creatures and the environments they inhabit and actively shape.

These terms -- concept, idea, thought, etc -- are sometimes used interchangeably, even in philosophy. But they also have technical uses where they would be kept separate. Here are a few points that might be important for distinguishing these terms.

Any of them can be used as a _type_ or a _token_. A token thought is the thing that's in my head or yours but not both, whereas the thought type could be shared.

The terms can also be used in concrete or abstract ways, and with more or less psychological emphasis. So, a concept is sometimes understood as abstract, but philosophers also talk about the physical, concrete, psychological thing too (either type or token...).

That's just the beginning really. There are theories and models in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology about what a concept, thought, sentence, etc. are. Each of those theories might differ on important details. For example, psychologists and philosophers theorize about whether token psychological concepts are atomic or compositional. (And the question of whether a concept is atomic doesn't really make sense when applied to the abstract notion of 'concept'.)

Cannot reduce minds to physics becuase meaning and purpose (teleology) is needed to describe actors, desires and actions. 
Me later: No, we can simply adopt the intentional stance
