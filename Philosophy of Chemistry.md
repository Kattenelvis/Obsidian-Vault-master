Unlike the epistemology of the empiristic tradition, in chemistry material properties are not classified according to the behaviour of objects, let alone phenomenalistic qualia, but according to experimental conditions. The conditions in question can be made explicit by listing contextual factors (cf. Schummer 1994):
(1) mechanical forces, (2) thermodynamical conditions (temperature, hydrostatical pressure), (3) electromagnetic fields, (4) other material objects or chemical substances (Section 4), (5) biological organisms, (6) ecological systems. According to the list of contextual factors chemists distinguish between: (10 ) mechanical properties (like elasticity), (20 ) thermodynamical properties (like specific heat capacity, melting point), 310 JOACHIM SCHUMMER (30 ) electromagnetic properties (like specific magnetic susceptibility, specific electric conductivity, optical absorption coefficient), summing up (10 ) â€“ (30 ) under the name of physical or physico-chemical properties; (40 ) chemical properties (like the capacity for oxidation or the solubility in a certain liquid), (50 ) biological or biochemical properties (like LD50, antibiotic or anaesthetic effect), (60 ) ecological properties (like ozone depletion potential (ODP), greenhouse effect factor). This list is neither systematically complete nor disjunctive. Because every context can be specified with respect to each of these factors, it is necessary to minimize or standardize the uninteresting factors for each case (working with inert container materials, minimizing electromagnetic fields, controlling thermodynamical standard conditions etc.). If two or more factors of interest are combined, it is possible to create new types of material properties (photo-chemical, thermo-electrical, thermo-electro-chemical etc.) (cf. Schummer 1997c).
