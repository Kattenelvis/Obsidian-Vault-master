  
John Haugeland, William Blatner, and Taylor Carman all argue for points from Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty in a fairly analytic style.

John McDowell's _Mind and World_ is one of the most influential books of analytic philosophy in the last thirty years, and it ends up being an argument for certain ideas from Hegel and Gadamer.





Erm so I think I have the following views:

1. The division between analytic and continental philosophy is real
2. The division is not reconcilable, no synthesis between the viewpoints can be made. 
3. The division is normative; analytic philosophy is correct, continental philosophy is incorrect.
4. The division is political; analytic philosophy should get public funding, continental philosophy should not get public funding.
