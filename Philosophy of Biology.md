In this essay I will argue that biological objects consume to live, but do not necessarily live to consume (but it is contingently the case in environments with low amounts of free-time or food sources)

First, some definitions: 
A biological object is an enclosed spatial region undertaking homeostatic processes with metabolism, employing extropy under environmental entropy while either sustaining itself indefinity or engaging in Darwinian or pseudo-Darwinian processes of reproduction. 

Consume to live: The employment of metabolism for undertaking homeostatic processes and sustained existence

Live to consume: The employment of metabolism exclusively as universal action set for a biological agent (a biological object which is also an agent).

It is the case, by the definition of a biological object and the consumption to live that all biological objects consume to live. However, there exists many instances of actions being taken by biological agents that do not involve metabolism. For example, play, humor or writing philosophy. For humans, as biological agents, there exists many examples of humans action-set having metabolism as a proper subset of the action-set. However, in some high-stress environments there could exist animals that do nothing but metabolism. I do not currently know of such an example, but it is up to the science of biology to figure that out.
