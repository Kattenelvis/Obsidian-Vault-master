One approach to dynamic semantics is _[discourse representation theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/discourse-representation-theory/)_ (DRT, Kamp 1981).

_dynamic predicate logic_ (


"
- dynamic representation. 
Sentences encode instructions for updating a certain kind of representation, and it is this representation, not sentences or other linguistic expressions, that is the primary object of compositional semantic interpretation. 

- Dynamic interpretation
The compositional semantic value of a sentence is a function from a body of information to a body of information."


Compared to statis interpretation:
"static. The compositional semantic value of a sentence is a truth-condition— a function from possible worlds to truth-values, or more generally, a function from indices (points of evaluation with a model) to truth-values."


"We can think of static and dynamic as competing high-level empirical hypotheses about what kind of thing the semantic value of a sentence is."

"The motivations we review stem from: (i) intersentential and donkey anaphora, (ii) the problem of presupposition projection, and (iii) the semantics of epistemic modals. We proceed in that order."

"As more information become presupposed in conversation, the satisfaction set shrinks."
