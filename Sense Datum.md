[[Philosophy of Perception]]

Sellars argue that Sense-datum theories cannot infer from sensing that region s is red to knowing s is red. We have an ordinary language usage of the word 'know' which is used beforehand. 

The orthodox view of sense-datum has a problem:

I'm most into abandoning 2)


Not an epistemic fact to have sense impressions. 
"Sense datum $S$ is $\phi$ $\rightarrow$ $K($Sense datum $S$ is $\phi)$" is false. There requires more to know that.

> Hegel endorses the generally Lockean view that universals emerge from immediate sensation that he now attributes to the nature of language. He begins by uncovering a basic difference, present in the title of this section, between the object, or 'this' _(dieses),_ the demonstrative pronoun that refers to what is simply present to consciousness, and what we have in mind in referring through demonstrative pronouns, or what we mean _(meinen)._ In calling attention to this disparity, in effect Hegel insists that, as concerns sense-certainty, we cannot say what we mean or mean what we say. The reason is that saying and meaning are separated by the intrinsic generality of language that identifies the true on the level of generality, whereas our immediate intention is to pick out the particular item given in sensation.


Implications for [[3. Formal Phenomenology]]?

Probably that any universal used in the project, including "hue" and "loudness" and so on are required to transmit particular experiences, however the experiences are particulars themselves and not universals. Something like that maybe.


> Hegel analyzes sense-certainty understood as an immediate, receptive grasp of what is as it is, apprehension without either comprehension or interpretation of any kind. "Our approach to the object must also be _immediate_ or _receptive,_ hence altering nothing in it as it presents itself and in grasping it refraining from comprehending it [von dem Auffassen das Begreifen abzuhalten]" (§90, 58*). Those committed to the English form of empiricism maintain that immediate experience is the only source of knowledge. Locke typically holds that simple ideas are always correct since "can none of them [i.e., simple ideas] be false in respect of things existing outside us."[11](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7d5nb4r8&chunk.id=endnotes&toc.id=&toc.depth=1&brand=ucpress&anchor.id=endnotes#X) This generally Lockean view remains popular. In our time it is reformulated by such Vienna Circle theorists as Rudolf Carnap and Moritz Schlick, who are concerned with so-called protocol sentences (_Protokollsätze_ ), and sense datum theorists, such as A. J. Ayer, who desire to reconstruct perceptions out of sensa. Hegel rejects this Lockean view, since he denies that immediate knowledge is the "richest" and "truest" kind of knowledge. It is in fact the very opposite, since "this _certainty_ proves itself to be the most abstract and poorest _truth"_ (§91, 58*).

> All that it says about what it knows is just that it is

>  We can only know what it is through other, richer, forms of knowledge.
