It's called the [Attention schema theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_schema_theory) It's the clearest theory I've heard which neither denies subjective awareness nor uses magical thinking. It's both mechanistic and functional.

It's also compatible with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory) which perhaps explains more of the "easy" problem of consciousness, and with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop#In_cognitive_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop#In_cognitive_science) which describes the "self" aspect of consciousness from an abstract point of view.

These three theories can be combined to produce an account like this:

The brain models its own attention. The model is wrong (but useful). With enough attention things spread to many areas of the brain. The model labels this as an experience, says a self possesses it, and attaches feelings and stories to it. We can attend to those, closing the loop (i.e. we pay attention to feelings and stories, the representations spread to other areas, which gets modeled... etc.)


Hard problem of consciousness: "How does matter give rise to consciousness?". As contrary to 'easy' problems such as cognition, memory and perception. 
Idea: The hard problem of consciousness pressuposes dualism and epiphenomenalism
