Suppes Operationalism:
"ll physical theories of any interest involve quantitative concepts, Le., functions. The values of some of these functions are obtained by calculations from 
functions appearing in other, more elementary physical theories. Ultimately, 
we must reach a point where certain quantitative concepts are linked directly 
to qualitative concepts. According to the empiricists, the link is described by 
'coordinating-definitions', 'correspondence rules' or 'meaning postulates'. For 
Suppes, this role is played by theories of fundamental measurement. As these 
theories are usually ignored by phYSicists, he considers it a task for the philosopher of science to formulate the theories of measurement which are implicitly 
contained in the standard expositions of physical theories. Only here is the 
point reached where the theory 'touches' reality: experiments, operations, and 
observations refer to the extensions of qualitative relations underlying the 
quantitative structures. The essential difference between the traditional operationalism or empiricism on the one hand and the method of Suppes on the 
other hand is characterized by Moulines and Sneed in this way: while those 
earlier theories introduce quantitative concepts by intra-theoretical relationship, as, e.g., in the case of correspondence rules, Suppes explicates a quantitative concept by inter-theoretical relationship. As distinguished from all earlier 
theories, his is a two-level theory which always refers to two parts: a higherlevel theory, containing the quantitative concept, and a lower-level theory, 
describing axiomatically certain operations and relations. The precise form of 
the link between the quantitative concept of the higher-level theory and its 
corresponding qualitative theory is stated in a representation theorem. In this 
theorem, the existence and uniqueness of the quantitative concept, satisfying 
some conditions formulated in the higher-level theory, is proved. The satisfiability of the axioms of the qualitative theory in a given domain thereby serves 
as a premise of the derivation. "
