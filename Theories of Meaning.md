Tarskiâ€“Davidson recursive theory of meaning
[Wright - Indeterminacy of Translation.pdf](file:///C:/Users/Katte/Documents/Academic/Philosophy/Wright%20-%20Indeterminacy%20of%20Translation.pdf)


Fido-"Fido" problem: The assumption that every meaningful sentance must have terms that have a referent. 

Idea: The picture theory of meaning can explain fiction but the verificationist theory of meaning cannot. 


Idea: The hypetico-deductive method, verification theory of meaning and picture theory of meaning: 
$\forall x  F(x)\rightarrow G(x)$
$F(n)$
$\therefore G(n)$

For empirical objects and empirical predicates mean that $F(x)\rightarrow G(x)$ is a verifiable statement. It's possibly falsified in the case of $F(n)\wedge\neg G(n)$ and according to the verifiability theory of meaning, meaningfull. However doesn't each premiss need to be meaningful to even make a deductive argument? They describe a picture, don't they?
