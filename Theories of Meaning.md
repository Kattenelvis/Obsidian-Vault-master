Tarskiâ€“Davidson recursive theory of meaning
[Wright - Indeterminacy of Translation.pdf](file:///C:/Users/Katte/Documents/Academic/Philosophy/Wright%20-%20Indeterminacy%20of%20Translation.pdf)


Fido-"Fido" problem: The assumption that every meaningful sentance must have terms that have a referent. 

Idea: The picture theory of meaning can explain fiction but the verificationist theory of meaning cannot. 


Idea: The hypetico-deductive method, verification theory of meaning and picture theory of meaning: 
$\forall x  F(x)\rightarrow G(x)$
$F(n)$
$\therefore G(n)$

For empirical objects and empirical predicates mean that $F(x)\rightarrow G(x)$ is a verifiable statement. It's possibly falsified in the case of $F(n)\wedge\neg G(n)$ and according to the verifiability theory of meaning, meaningfull. However doesn't each premiss need to be meaningful to even make a deductive argument? They describe a picture, don't they?

    Thre's no fact of the matter which truthmakers are the actual truthmakers. All we see is that that words are used in certain contexts and in certain ways, but it doesn't mean that they represent concrete facts. There are infinitely many ways to set up these truthmakers (because of indeterminacy of translation) and we can't determine any specific way to do that. No matter what data we might have, we still wouldn't be able to do that, so it's the most reasonable to assume that language doesn't represent, but is merely pragmatic tool regulated by conventions

    The picture theory can't really apply to certain meaningful expressions, which is why Wittgenstein abandoned it:

1. You're mixing up metaphysics and epistemology. There may still be a fact of the matter there exists a truthmaker M for proposition p. That we are systematically underdetermined for various reasons can be resolved with structural realism, where all we need is the Ramsey sentence âˆƒt_1,...âˆƒt_n T(x_1,.... x_n,o_1,\dots o_m) which tells us that there are some theoretical terms t_1,...t_n which imply the observation sentences. While the true truthmakers, say m1,...mk are unknown (most likely unknowable) which would give us the true theory of the world that explains all observations T(m1,...mn,o1,...om) which is also the true one. Our ignorance is not evidence for their absence. Observation sentences may include the experience of audio which we take to be voices and uses of language by what we take to be agents. We still form theoretical terms of words and meaning, observations could be underdetermined between any number of meanings, agential intentional states (by Quine's indeterminacy of meaning argument). However we can use other theoretical terms, such as neural configurations, lung-throat-vibrations or quantum field configurations. These describe the state of the world, which imply one's observations. With enough data, we can figure out such a theory which also explain all word uses. And even more here, is that I think that the truth-makers for observational statements is the sense-data it is based on. The truth-maker is directly accessible through phenomenal consciousness. As such, we can represent sense data such as regions of blue, or regions of red (which can be mathematically formalized). I think that statements about observation sentences are thus representative of some true fact, and the experience in phenomenal consciousness is the truth maker of such propositions. The private language argument does not hold up as an attack against this view, for self-aimed correctness conditions are doable. (Ã¤ndrad)

    Firstly, there's nothing which states such propositions have to be meaningful. We may be using meaningless phrases in a linguistic community. We would simply have to reject a lot of what we think to be meaningful is actually nonsense. However most of what you bring up is in no way going against the picture theory of meaning. Firstly, there is a distinction between semantics and pragmatics. If we're only interested in semantics, we can ignore the contextual speech-act related properties of such propositions. When we're analyzing the semantics of propositions themselves, a picture theory seems completely reasonable, as the literal content of sentences would be about configurations of atomic facts in logical relations between them. Some like Davidsson argues that for metaphors, the literal meaning is just as important as the contextual speech-act (or he argues something like that). Words like "Hello" may be semantically meaningless but nevertheless a rational speech act agents perform out of being punished or rewarded for such behavior and as such optimizes expectation value by taking such actions.
