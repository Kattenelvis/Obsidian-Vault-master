> When some steps of a complex, multi-step task are automated, the demand for human
work in the remaining complementary sub-tasks goes up. In contrast, when the task is
fully automated, the demand for human work declines. Upon aggregation to the
macroeconomic scale, partial automatability of complex tasks creates a bottleneck of
development, where further growth is constrained by the scarcity of essential human
work. This bottleneck is removed once the tasks become fully automatable. Theoretical
analysis using a two-level nested constant elasticity of substitution production function
specification demonstrates that the shift from partial to full automation generates a
non-convexity: humans and machines switch from complementary to substitutable, and
the share of output accruing to human workers switches from an upward to a downward
trend. This process has implications for inequality, the risk of technological
unemployment, and the likelihood of a secular stagnation

Multi-step optimization process:

1. Ensuring no human dies or otherwise rapidly loose standard of living or pushed out of the economy/country.
2. Full Automation is reached.
3. No decrease in happiness or standard of living, staving off some kind of existential nihilism.
4. Prevent the creation of "bullshit jobs"


Can I solve this, atleast for Sweden or the EU?

America does all the hard work and the EU reaps all the benefits.

There's alread a lot of work on AI safety. Is there enough work on prevent extreme power concentration that ensures everyone survive and benefit and not juts the wealthy few?

Tax automation proportional to unemployment rate? Might lead to the creation of bullshit jobs by the ruling class to prevent taxes. In the long run, I'd suspect that companies which don't have bullshit jobs eventually go out of business, but there might be some serious institutional reasons this doesn't happen.

# Idea (good for rhetorics): people who only live of off universal basic income are not unemployed but post-employed!



Idea: Could the ruling class consolidate power and automate to such an extent that it doesn't even need consumers anymore, they can remain alive and well on that alone?

If all labor can be done by machines, why would they need people to buy their goods? They can just produce their energy and luxury products themselves, without anyone there to work for them, and without anyone to give them money as they don't need any.
