Freedom as an infinitely valued good, over happiness, knowledge e.t.c.

Existentialism --> Libertarian Free will?

Not necessarily, Sartre seems to accept some kind of soft determinism when he states how sociocultural impacts changes decision procedures.

Now for the formulation:
Let an existential preference relation $R$ on possible worlds $W$, such that for any $x,y\in W$ we have it that $xRy$ iff $x$ has "more freedom" than $y$. 

Since it is value monist, we can assume completeness. Assume no freedom circles can form, so we have transitivity. Then we can map it onto an utility function $U$ that maps possible worlds to how much freedom they have.

Though "how much freedom" they have could be total freedom summed over all individuals, in which case fascism is still possible (since for any world of equal freedom $ef$, there exists some world $fa$ such that $fa$ has 0 freedom for all individuals except for one which has slightly more freedom than the sum of $ef$). 

So since existentialist are not fascists, they are going to adopt some minimax rule, or atleast leximin rule, over state of affairs.
