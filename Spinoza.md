1.  1. Universal Intelligibility (Principle of sufficient reason + universalism) which means all possible ideas humans can have csn be thought; and if there is an "idea which cannot be thought" then it does not exist. Spinoza denies actual infinities everywhere **except** in the immanent intellect of God (which is effectively a flow of intuitions [which no one knows what spinoza meant by intuition lmao since it was likely a reference to some other obscure work we dont yet know]. And is effectively like looking down a bottomless pit of these so-called intuitions (which I think are merely possible intuitions in the kantian sense, or immediate sense in Hegel). 2. Barrier Principle, as background, Spinoza says there are two attributes that humans know of; Thought, and extension (or corporeality and incorporeality). Spinoza also says there is no causation between thought and extension. This means that for spinoza, if something happens to the body, we CANNOT know this through mind, and can only know through the body. And likewise, A thought can occur, and said thought cannot be known by the body. This indeed means that you can analyse neurons and never know what the mind is doing; or you can analyse a thought and never know what the neurons are doing. However, this does not mean we cannot correspond them. Infact, spinoza is a monist and psycho-physical parallelist. So the event in mind, and the event in the body, occur immediately in space and time. So unlike modern science (Since like Hobbes and Bacon), where we think of the mind as an emergent property of bodies; Spinoza says that the body and mind are coemergent; they are emergent properties of a third term; our essence. Essence is directly in Gods Will, Power, or Intellect (the intellect is the aforementioned bottomless hole of all possible intuitions) (the will and power of god are seperate entities, but spinoza calls them expressions of the same). 3. Infinite Thinker. This is tge aforementioned Infinite intellect,

    The infinite intellect is effectively the idea where the idea and thinker is inseperable. Thus, the act of thinking (becoming), and the reality of the thought (being) is indistinguishable in the infinite thinker; that is, in Gods mind.
    
5.  _[_21:42_]_
    
    Thus, whatever God thinks, also occurs. But these events are causally independent, since they are God understanding his essence under different modes. The infinite mind/intellect is the mode of Gods essence under Thought, and his will is Gods essence under extension. Gods power is the general term for both these seperate modes of Gods essence. Also, these modes of essence, namely, God contemplating himself, are attribute; basically cyclic automorphisms in God.
    
6.  _[_21:43_]_
    
    So God doesnt think up something and it appears. Rather he creates the physical thing, and the infinite ideas of that thing, simultaneously. They are parallel but causally independent powers of God
    
7.  _[_21:44_]_
    
    The sum of all powers of God are called Gods immanence. On this note, Spinoza says God is the immanent cause.

    So that concludes the discussion of Axioms. Now Ill give a good analogy...
    
10.  _[_21:46_]_
    
    So spinoza says there is a physical world, right? So in this physical world; our physical body roams. Spinoza also says there is a mental world which our body roams; so our mind is effectively the same power as our body.
    
11.  _[_21:48_]_
    
    So mind is a determinate distribution of Power in the mental world; and our physical body is a determinate dostribution of Power in the physical world; their quantity (I.e amount of power) is the same, but the quality of the power is different. Essence is the power itself; power/essence can be thought of as the modern physical meaning of energy.
    
12.  _[_21:51_]_
    
    So our physical bodies walk in a physical world. And spinoza says our mental "bodies" (or minds) walk in a mental world. Instead of the mind being a container of ideas, instead, the mind is a perciever of ideas which do notnspecifically belong to that mind; Ideas are not mine or yours ontologically, but only pragmatically; all ideas belong to no one, just like how physical bodies belong to no one, and that identity is merely a fiction. This is radical political implications, which Spinoza uses to basically call religion bullshit, and prove that kings are not really rulers by natural law (ordained by god); because in reality, for spinoza, no idea, and no body, belongs to anyone but God.

    Also huge distinction, Gods mind is nothing like ours. God doesnt feel emotions like us. Rather, he thinks up all possible emotions, which we then inherit due to our natural and necesssary location in the order of the natural universe.
    
15.  _[_21:52_]_
    
    God merely thinks up all possible worlds; which we then partake in.
    
16.  _[_21:53_]_
    
    Spinoza calls this perfect knowledge. God creates perfect knowledge, and we partake only in a part of said knowledge, which is called imperfect knowledge. So in relation to God, our knowledge is imperfect, but in relation to ourselves, our knowledge is perfect (since at any given moment, there is only one idea; the idea present to us).




Imagine infinite number of modes. "Physical substance best explains out scientific models" Well then we create a new substance A defined to be that substance which best models our scientific models and is non-physical. B can be defined likewise, with added condition "not like A" e.t.c.
