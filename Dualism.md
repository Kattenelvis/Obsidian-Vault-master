Does consciousness collapse theories of QM imply (substance) dualism? Where measurement is a psycho-physical law? Where the physical substance causally interact on some set of laws (the laws of QM) while wave-function collapse and quantum decoherence are the psycho-physical laws where mental causes have physical effects.

Searle says strong AI needs dualism to be true.  

Two types of dualism: Property dualism and substance dualism

Seems as if substance dualism requires two (or even three) separate theories which quantify over different domains. One theory the mental, the other the physical. If parallelism is false when it comes to the causal interactions between the substances, then you also need a theory to describe the interaction between them which needs to quantify over both substances and this theory would then obviously require a mental predicate $M$ and a physical predicate $P$ so substance dualism implies property dualism. 

It's easier to have just one theory which describes the world with two types of predicates. $M$ and $P$ which are second order predicates. Take any random predicate $Q$, if $Q$ is a mental property then $M(Q)$ is true.
