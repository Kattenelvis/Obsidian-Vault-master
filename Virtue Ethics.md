What are the truth maker for virtue ethical statements?

Let F be a virtue ("Courageous", "Emotionally strong" e.t.c). What properties count as a virtue? The necessary and sufficient conditions need to be defined.

Then one can analyse scientifically which people have such virtues and to what extend they have it. The extension of a virtue is a fuzzy set, i.e people hold on to a virtue of different degrees.
