Combinatorial creativity: Combining old things to make something new (AI art?)

-

1.  1) art is information
    
2.  _[_17:05_]_
    
    a song is a sequence of notes, a painting is a sequence of sequences of colors, etc It's actually a bit more complex but more on that later (ändrad)
    
3.  _[_17:06_]_
    
    it's not a particular physical object that is art, but the information that it contains for the senses
    
4.  _[_17:06_]_
    
    2) a piece of information _is_ a number
    
5.  _[_17:08_]_
    
    you could, with an adequate encryption schema independent of art itself, put every art piece onto the number line
    
6.  _[_17:13_]_
    
    there's a bit more detail to this, but ultimately, everything could be mapped onto a unique point. and every point could be mapped back into a piece. Obviously, most randomly generated pieces are essentially static, lacking connection to our reality. You could absolutely imagine, for any art piece generated thus, some sort of a thinking being in some other possible reality that would enjoy it; but we are just one of such configurations. The work of an artist is ultimately to sweep through the number line and find the numbers least like static and more like something that maps onto our prefrences.
    
7.  _[_17:13_]_
    
    3) information is - numbers are - _timeless_
    
8.  _[_17:15_]_
    
    there's no difference between a 4 written today and a 4 written a thousand years ago. there's no difference between a 7 written by a saint or by a maniac. there's no difference between F=ma written originally by Newton or today by me.
    
9.  _[_17:17_]_
    
    out of this follows that art itself cannot be original (through _art creation process_ can be.) that the relationship between an imitated piece and an imitating piece is a _symmetrical_ relationship - of similarity
    
10.  _[_17:20_]_
    
    one can be more or less pleasing to humans but that doesn't have anything to do with their chronological order _unless_ you have novelty as your prefrence and you _systematically_ experience everything as it's released.
    
11.  _[_17:21_]_
    
    but if you are a modern listener deciding between a 70s innovative band and a 00s knockoff, the release date in the corner of the recording means nothing - should mean nothing. whatever you'll listen to first will get the novelty valur (ändrad)

    and yeah anything that appears to be a valuing of originality in art is either valuing novelty in art or valuing originality in artist, because originality isn't a fact about art (ändrad)



This is very based, and I completely agree. In Digital Phenomenology (DP) we already have that rigorously defined that sense information is mathematical. Example is a point in the visual field {x,y,h,b} where x is the x-position on the visual field, y is y-position, h is hue and b is brightness. A point of audio is {f,l} for frequency f and loudness l. My experience is then a set of these sets E = {Set of visual points, Set of auditory points,...}. One can take subsets, unions, intersections and the powerset of my experience. For reasons I'll could get to later, we use FST (finitist set theory) so no infinite sets are available. 

However what we (or atleast I) did not think about was that each of these sets can be encoded into a unique number with a bijection. Thus, a subset of experience such as an artwork or a piece of music can be encoded into numbers. But this set of numbers can in turn be put into a function that encodes the entire experience into a unique number! 

Now it's a good idea to think about what "enjoyment" means, I think it can be defined the following: A subset of experience that is one's pleasure. So if one subset of experience is the artwork, another subset is the pleasure, then the union of the two sets could be the aesthetic experience, which can also be encoded into numbers. Thus any artwork-pleasure pair can map into numbers f : {A,P} --> N and let f be a bijection. 


3 definitions: Representation, Expression, Formal Properties. 

Weitz’s Open Concept Argument: any concept is open if a case can be imagined which would call for some sort of decision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover it, or to close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case; all open concepts are indefinable; and there are cases calling for a decision about whether to extend or close the concept of art. Hence art is indefinable (Weitz 1956)





A Turing machine can iterate over all artworks
All n by m resolution by k colors gives 
$nmk$ possible artworks for some resolution and number of colors. So all possible artowks is infinite. But if we put some reasonable bounds N, M and K, we get
$\sum_n^N \sum_m^M \sum_k^K nmk$

possible artworks. Same goes for music for frequencies f and decibel level d for length t.
