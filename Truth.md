Good video, however, some objections:

  

Correspondence:

Given an object x that is a set where each member is some fundamental substance (like atoms, or pixels of perception e.t.c depending on materialism or idealism respectively) then one can construct a new object x* by adding or removing one member of this set. This just creates two objects where the proposition "x is F" is true (corresponds to reality) but " x* is F" is false (does not correspond to reality), making it "relative", but only insofar as two actors A and B have a language problem that makes them think they're talking about the same thing but are actually talking about different objects.

  

Coherence:

"I can create two sets of beliefs that are coherent, explanatory and simple", has this actually been done? Has this been demonstrated or is it an asumption? As a constructivist (in the philosophy of mathematics) I believe this needs to be demonstrated.

  

Pragmatist:

What's not to say that rational actors converge on a single set of propositions? There are reasons to believe this can be the case Consider a set of n subjects that update their beliefs in a rational way(like for example, Bayesian updating). If all actors do this, then Aumann's agreement theorem indicate that their beliefs converge.

  

Deflationary: Anti-inflationary, that is, they see truth as something less idk

Conjunction for example, $p\wedge q\wedge\dots\wedge w$ is true iff for all p in the conjunct, p is true
