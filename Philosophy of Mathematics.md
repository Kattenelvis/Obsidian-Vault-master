When it comes to mathematics I recommend [intuitionism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/) since it states that mathematical objects are experiences of the mind (rather than things in themselves i.e platonism). I also recommend [finitist set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitist_set_theory), which are subsets of set theory that are complete and decidable (which means one can construct an algorithm and find out if they are coherent).

Great beginner questions!

1.  Gödel had multiple arguments for platonism. In his Gibbs lecture, he presented an argument that platonism can be a possible (but not the only possible) consequence of incompleteness. I recommend [Raatikainen's "On the Philosophical Relevance of Godel's Incompleteness Theorems"](https://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-philosophie-2005-4-page-513.htm#s1n10) for an accessible introduction.
    
2.  Your question seems to be closely related to what is known as [Benaceraff's multiple reduction (or identification) problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benacerraf%27s_identification_problem). So much has been written about the problem! You may start from [the structuralist solution to this problem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structuralism-mathematics/#Begi1960BenaPutn), even though this is of course not the only approach.
    
3.  Again, so much has been written about this problem. T[he set-theoretic multiverse approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(set_theory)) is one of the recent approaches widely debated.
