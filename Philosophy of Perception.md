As in:
$K_i (P(x))$

Then the set of all known properties of object $x$ grows as we move to the right. 

And indiscernible have different relation properties to an observer $o$
$R(o, x)\neq R(o,y)\rightarrow x\neq y$

Some experience-states are more desired than others

There can exist irrationalities such that the preference structure of experience-states is non-transitive. 

Assume transitivity, then it is a partial order. Perhaps a lattice structure

Argument for indirect realism?
"In "Consciousness, Explained", Daniel Dennett describes the experiment where a red light on one side of our peripheral vision and a green light on the other, when flashed too close together for them to be processed separately, get perceived as a single moving object that changes color."
[philosophy of mathematics - Is Brouwer's notion of time that of a continuum? - Philosophy Stack Exchange](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/26453/is-brouwers-notion-of-time-that-of-a-continuum)

TBH the whole answer is interesting

"The experience of the current moment being different from the memory of the previous moment is a discrete phenomenon. Our memory is instantaneous and qualitatively isolated from any other remembered moment. Memory is not continuous, it is itemized. Each event we attend to has the feeling of two-oneness, of becoming an event.

But if we back away from our concrete memory and concentrate on the possible memories we might have had, we find that we might have had memories between any two we actually have. Consciousness is continuous, even if perception is not.

To put this in less vague frame, look at how it plays out in actual phenomenal experience near the limit of our processing resolution.

In "Consciousness, Explained", Daniel Dennett describes the experiment where a red light on one side of our peripheral vision and a green light on the other, when flashed too close together for them to be processed separately, get perceived as a single moving object that changes color.

We perceive the single event of there being a ribbon of light across our visual field which is red on one end and green on the other. But in retrospect we can identify the point where our brain assigns the (illusory) change in color because we naturally force continuity on our discrete sequential experience. So time is experience as continuous, but the experiences are discrete, and mapped onto the continuum artificially.

Since the interpolated continuity is at a different level of processing, and not made up of the actual discrete events, but interpolated from them, one cannot connect them in a way that makes the continuum a collection of points. We are prevented from undoing the illusion, because it is necessary to our narrative arc. From an extreme position, if we want to be intuitively motivated, we should respect this difficulty as natural to our psychology and not pretend we can remove it."


< Idea >
Mathematical-Statistical analysis of phenomenal space. Works with either discrete/continious time and either discrete/continious perception (i.e the general coordinates for visual space for example are integers vs real numbers, both are bounded however). 

Different regions of visual space have different colors. Take a region A. This region has some statistical probability of containing say 23% red e.t.c over some period of time. Correlations between colors can be made over time. One can statistically evaluate all phenomenal spaces.

"Dogmatism about perceptual justification is named after the response to external-world skepticism that it recommends. When the skeptic claims that perception cannot justify beliefs about the external world, the dogmatist thinks it is reasonable to reply that simply having a visual experience can give one reason to believe one's eyes, even without having independent justification to think there is an external world.  And analogous replies for auditory, gustatory, olfactory and other perceptual experiences (including multimodal ones) are supposed to be equally reasonable. In the hands of dogmatists, G.E. Moore was basically right when he purported to refute the skeptic by holding up a hand (which presumably he could see) and telling the skeptic that he was sure he had a hand.  Dogmatist theses are often formulated in terms of two notions:_defeater_ and _immediate justification._ To a first approximation, defeaters are reasons to believe that the experience is not a good guide to the way things are. One dogmatist thesis is that a perceptual experience with the content P (such as "here is a hand") provides justification for believing P, absent defeaters for the experience.  A different dogmatist thesis is that a perceptual experience with content P provides immediate justification for believing P, absent defeaters. To a first approximation, justification from experience for believing P is immediate, if there are no other proposition Q such that one needs to rely on one's justification for Q to have justification from experience to believe P. The thesis that perceptual experiences provide immediate justification is compatible both with _reliabilism_ about justification and with non-reliablist theories of justification.  Dogmatism is appealing for its simplicity, and for preserving the intuitive idea that the external-world skeptic cannot be right. But in assigning so much rational power to perceptual experiences, it raises several questions. What gives perceptual experiences those rational powers? Is it the phenomenal character of the experience, its content, the status of the experience as reliable,  some combination, or other factors? Can there be immediate justification?"
