Use scrap vegetables to make a vegetable stock. Comment from that video:
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2Vs6doemmh4

FREE PRO TIPS FROM A GLUTTON: 1. Do not add ingredients that are easily broken down, are rich in starch, or are known for their strong flavours. They can make the stock cloudy and might add some unpleasant flavours. 2. If you like a veggie stock with added tomatoes, remove the seeds. They will make the stock bitter. 3. When preparing a veggie stock, make absolutely sure your produce is clean, don't leave any dirt or roots. 4. The best colour for the veggie stock is light amber. It can also be Light yellow or golden. Lighter colour means a smaller amount of ingredients per litter of water, and vice versa. This can change if you have not followed the previous tips. 5. The top ingredients for a perfect veggie stock are: Onions, Celery, Carrots, Leaks 6. Don't over-boil it, simmer it down but don't leave it for more than 1 hour. For a meat stock, it will be the complete opposite. Hope y'all have delicious meals ahead! Comment if I have missed something, or if you have any questions or suggestions. Apparently, there are some interesting questions and suggestions in the sub-comments, so in order to avoid repetition I will edit this comment giving additional info, crediting the people who have suggested something interesting with (S – “NAME”: suggestion). Also, mark the questions with Q and the answers with A for people who are coming back to this or are new to the conversation. S - @LesbianWitchAcademia: “Roast your veggies first! You’ll get so much more rich and deep flavours out of just a light roast. - 375 F° ( 190 C°) for 20 min.” S - @Cas Bolt: “Never salt your broth stock beforehand, wait to do it a few minutes before it’s done!” S - @2 Goats in a Trench Coat: “You can make the stock at the last minute before making a recipe and strain it directly into your cooking pot. Then you don’t need to worry about storing it!” S - @Flame: “Some of the ingredients might be unpleasant to some, and others might not grow or be sold in different regions of the world, see what you can substitute them with. Before pepping the stock you can roast some of the products, you are planning to use. Careful though, you don’t want them to burn and form a char that later will give an unpleasant flavour to the stock/broth. People with less experience might prefer to skip the roasting.” Q: “What is the period of expiration?” A – In general, you can keep homemade vegetable stock in the refrigerator for up to a week and in the freezer for up to a month. Provided that it is in the proper container, and you have knowledge of food preservation, it can last for much longer. Although it is suggested to use it as much as possible, as new scraps will keep coming in. If you are facing a dire situation, I suggest reducing it as much as you can and freezing it into ice cubes which then you will store in vacuumed packages in the freezer, then it might last for about 6 months. Q: “What can you use veggie stock for?” A – You can use it in a variety of dishes as a substitute for water, like in soups, stews, sauces, and gravies. Bring it to a boil, salt it to taste, and add some cut pork chops and some noodles, done. Or use it instead of water when you are making rice, it will give a punch of flavours and a bouquet of aromas to this tasteless grain. Plus the extra nutrients... Q: “Can I make it even though the veggies are non-bio?” A – Yes you can. The main difference between organic and non-organic vegetables is the structure of the sugar molecules, which are slowly disappearing as technology progresses. Q: “Any alternatives if I am missing any of the top products used in the stock?” A – Absolutely, you can use more of the ones you already have, or here is a list of ingredients and spices you might have easy access to, keep in mind that I am listing them with my own experience at hand, so you should try and judge their taste/aroma for yourself: - Carrots: Excellent for making stock/broth. Carrot tops, Use only in very small quantities. - Celery stalks: Excellent for making stock/broth. Celery leaves, well the outer leaves can make the stock bitter, a small amount of the inner leaves can be used with good results. - Chard: Good in small quantities. - Chives: Good in small quantities. - Coriander/Cilantro: it's too strong for broth/stock. If you really want to use it, be sure to only use a very small amount. A little goes a long way. - Fennel bulbs, including their cores - Seaweed, such as dried kombu, nori, or wakame - Whole black peppercorns - Skin-on ginger - Miso - Soy sauce, gluten-free tamari, liquid amines, coconut amines, or MSG - Asparagus: Good in small quantities - Basil: Good in very small quantities. - Bay leaves: 1 or 2 leaves per litre of liquid is a good amount. - Beetroots: can be added, but they will turn the stock a very dark colour, which may not work well for some purposes, such as butternut squash soup. Beet skins should not be used. Beet Greens: Good in small quantities. You may want to add them toward the end of cooking as they break down quickly. - Corn: Corn doesn’t add a lot of flavours and can make the stock/broth cloudy. Corn cobs can be added too. - Cucumber: I don't know if it actually does something, but the trash is a second option. - Dill: Seasonal addition. - Eggplant/Aubergine: Good in small quantities. If it's not treated with salt it might give off a weird taste and unnecessary colour to the stock/broth. - Garlic: Excellent for making stock/broth. - Green beans: Yes, if you have only the pods, then they are fine too. - Jerusalem artichokes: Yes, don't overdo it. - Leeks: Excellent for making stock/broth. - Marjoram: Not many people like it. It's fine though. - Mushrooms: Mushrooms add rich flavour to vegetable stock. Shrooms are life, and life is good, except when it's toxic! :D - Okra: You can add some. Use in small quantities to avoid overwhelming the flavour. In my view, this thing should be stopped from production worldwide. I hate it! - Onions: You aren't doing anything without them. Onion skins add an amazing colour. Just don’t add too many of them unless you want your stock to have a dark colour. Remember good veggie stock comes out in three colour variations, Light yellow, golden, or light amber. And it's rather clear, i. e. you can almost see through it. - Oregano: Yes, just a bit. - Parsley: In my humble opinion, it won't be a veggie stock without parsley, it just adds that early summer aroma. - Parsnips: I still regret discarding so many of them years ago. - Peas: Good in small quantities. They don't add much, but it’s better than throwing them away. - Pea Pods: Not usually at hand, but when I have them I toss them in! - Hot Peppers: Just no! - Sweet Peppers, Bell Peppers: It's fine, no seeds though! - Rosemary: Some people like the taste rosemary imparts to stock/broth, but some find it lends a bitter flavour, so you may want to use it with caution. Personally, I love it more in Chicken stock. - Scallions: Yes. Don't chop them just toss 'em in. Roots optional. - Shallots: peel, meat, stems, some people add the roots too, but I am not a big fan of that! - Spinach: Yes, released it's iron and makes it extremely packed in nutritional value. Add towards the end, and it might give off green colouring which is not okay for some dishes! - Potato peels: Can be used in very small quantities. Potato skins add an earthy, but slightly bitter taste. Too many can make the stock cloudy. Be sure the peels are very clean, otherwise, you’ll end up with stock that tastes like dirt. - Sweet Potatoes: Starchy, the peel might be okay, if it's clean and with no meat left on it. Perhaps after boiling them and separating the peel, don't throw it away... - Thyme, Sage: I've seen people use them, tried and didn't like them. I prefer them in meat stock as they add to the much-necessary bulk of flavours. You can try for yourself though! - Tomatoes: Excellent for stock, remove the seeds. Additionally, I like to paste them with the peel. Then you strain the stock through a mesh cloth and nothing is left behind to make it unpleasant. No seeds make the stock bitter. - Lettuce: Good in small quantities. Most lettuce varieties don’t add much flavour to the stock/broth, but they are great sponges to suck out any impurities. The hard part much like a turnip, or radish might add a bitter flavour. - Romaine Lettuce: Good in small quantities. - Napa Cabbage, Kale, Bok Choy, Collard Greens, Broccoli, Cabbage, Kohlrabi, and Rutabagas: These foods from the Brassica family, are way too strong for stock/broth and can impart a bitter taste. - Turnips: Part of the Brassica family. Turnips are too strong for stock or broth. Although you might find the flavour interesting as a sort of this vegetable is used a lot in Mid-Asian cuisines. (China, Korea, Japan) Turnip greens it's fine in small quantities. - Radish: It's a turnip but bigger! - Pumpkin: it's a little too starchy for good stock or broth. The peel? Maybe I haven't tried it. - Squash/ Winter squash/ Acorn squash- is a little too starchy for good stock or broth. Peels with as little flesh on them are okay. - Zucchini: they don't feel right to me, you can try but don't put too many
