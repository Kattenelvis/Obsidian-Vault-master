"The study of the acoustics and articulation of speech is called phonetics. Once you’ve translated the waves of sound into mental representations of speech sounds, you analyze them into syllables and pattern them appropriately. For example, speakers of English know that the made-up word bluve is a possible word of English, but the word bnuck is not. This is part of the science called phonology. Then you take these groups of sounds and organize them into meaningful units (called morphemes) and words. For example, the word dancer is made up of two meaningful bits: dance and the suffix -er. The study of this level of Language is called morphology. Next you organize the words into phrases and sentences. Syntax is the cover term for studies at this level of Language. Finally, you take the sentences and phrases you hear and translate them into thoughts and ideas. This last step is what we refer to as the semantic level of Language."

The dominant theory of syntax is due to Noam Chomsky and his colleagues, starting in the mid 1950s and continuing to this day. This theory, which has had many different names through its development 
- Transformational Grammar (TG)
- Transformational Generative Grammar
- Standard Theory
- Extended Standard Theory
- Government and Binding Theory (GB)
- Principles and Parameters approach (P&P)
- Minimalism (MP))

They are often given the blanket name Generative Grammar. A number of alternate theories of syntax have also branched off of this research program. These include 
- Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG)
- Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).

"The particular version of generative grammar that we will mostly look at here is roughly the Principles and Parameters approach, although we will occasionally stray from this into the more recent version called Minimalism"

"In syntax, hypotheses are called rules, and the group of hypotheses that describe a language’s syntax is called a grammar."


The rest of the section follows the scientific method when analyzing anaphors using new examples to rule out old hypothesises when they can no longer explain why certain sentences are grammatically correct or not. 
- gender
- number
- person


Garden Path Sentences are difficult for ordinary speakers to parse. Example:

Cotton shirts are made from comes from India


This can be disambiguiated as "The Cotton that shirts are made from comes from India"



Center embedding
15) Who did Bill say Frank claimed that Mary seems to have been likely to have kissed?


"17) #Cheese mice cats catch love stinks"

A problem not due to grammar, but due to the nature of short-term memory and so on.

"In his excellent book The Atoms of Language, Mark Baker inventories a set of possible parameters of language variation within the UG hypothesis."

Word types (noun, adjective e.t.c) are not defined based on semantics (such as all nouns being things e.t.c) but rather it's position in a sentence and it's prefixes and suffixes.
