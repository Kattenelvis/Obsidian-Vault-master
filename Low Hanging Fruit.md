Suppose you are fishing without replacement from a deep pond. At first, catching
fish is easy. The fish you catch dwell in shallow waters and are easily fooled into
biting. But as time goes on, the time between catches grows longer. Now the fish left
in the pond are shrewder and dwell deeper underwater. Catching a fish goes from a
matter of minutes to a matter of hours, days, or weeks
Many social scientists think that beyond a point, nearly all idea-generating
processes behave like fishing. As low-hanging fruit is plucked, good ideas become
harder to find (Bloom et al., 2020; Kortum, 1997; Gordon, 2016).
