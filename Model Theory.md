[Challenges to Metaphysical Realism > The Model-Theoretic Argument and the Completeness Theorem (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-sem-challenge/model-theory-completeness.html)


xample 1.3.15 Let  = {p}, and let T = {p}. Let  = {p,q}, and let T  = {p}. Here we must think of T and T  as different theories, even though they consist of the same sentences – i.e., T = T  . One reason to think of these as different theories: T is complete, but T  is incomplete. Another reason to think of T and T  as distinct is that they have different deductive closures. For example, q ∨ ¬q is in the deductive closure of T  , but not of T . The point here turns out to be philosophically more important than one might think. Quine argued (correctly, we think) that choosing a theory is not just choosing axioms, but axioms in a particular language. Thus, one can’t tell what theory a person accepts merely by seeing a list of the sentences that she believes to be true.
