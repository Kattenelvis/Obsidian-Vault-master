Autological and Heterological, seems like LEM is the problem here lmao.

Liknande:

Self-containment: Får ej hänvisa till self-containment.
Bijektion mellan satser som deriveras från axiomer till världen.
Flera modeller skulle vara ett val i meta språket
Detta bryter antagandet om self-containment och därför kan endast absoluta system (system med endast en modell) ha en bijektion i världen.

Buridan's Ass: An donkey cannot make the decision between two equal hay stacks and dies of starvation. 
In full generality, a decision maker cannot choose between two discrete choises with continious inputs.

Physics could still be continiious, but there need be a finite perception of all subjects making decisions. When in an experiment, a rat slowly makes the decision to pick between two equal choises by first being indecisive and then going towards the one it's oh so slightly close to. This may mean the variables when processed by the brain can only be discrete and not continious.

The argument known as “Meno's Paradox” can be reformulated as follows: **If you know what you're looking for, inquiry is unnecessary**. If you don't know what you're looking for, inquiry is impossible. Therefore, inquiry is either unnecessary or impossible

Kroki-Paradoxen: Man ritar dansande gubbar, men dom är stilla på papperet. Hur går det ihopp?!+!?!?


“the paradox of confirmation.”
"For logic tells us that “All As are Bs” if and only if “All non-Bs are non-As.” To see this, consider what would be an exception to “All As are Bs.” It would be an A that was not a B. But this would also be the only exception to “All non-Bs are non-As.” Accordingly, statements of these two forms are logically equivalent. In consequence, all swans are white if and only if all non-white things are non-swans. The two sentences are logically equivalent formulations of the same statement. Since the black boot is a non-white non-swan, it is a positive instance of the hypothesis that all non-white things are non-swans, a.k.a. all swans are white. The black boot is a positive instance of the hypothesis that all swans are white. To many it will seem as though something has gone seriously wrong here! Surely the way to assess a hypothesis about swans is not to examine boots!"

There are two broad strategies for dealing with this paradox. Hempel’s preferred approach was simply to accept that black boots confirm the hypothesis about all swans being white, and to explain the feeling that they don’t do so away as a logically unsophisticated attitude we can disregard. The other alternative is to argue that if “all swans are white” is a law, it must express some necessary connection between being a swan and whiteness.

"It is worth noting here that exponents of a Bayesian approach to induction argue that the paradox of confirmation is no problem for Bayesianism. After all, the prior conditional probability of a boot being black, conditional on all swans being white, is lower than the prior probability of the next swan we see being white, conditional on all swans being white. When we plug these two priors into Bayes’ theorem, if the prior probabilities of seeing a white swan and a black boot are equal, the probability of “all swans are white” is raised much more by the conditional probability of seeing a white swan, conditional on all swans being white"

Grue is defined from two primitive notions: Time and Color. Green and Blue only use the primitive notion of Color.
