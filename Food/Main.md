Creamy chicken carbonara

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized strips 12â€“14 ounces linguine 4 strips thick-cut bacon (or pancetta), chopped into 1/2 inch pieces 2 cloves garlic, minced salt and pepper, to taste

CARBONARA SAUCE

4 eggs 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/3 c pasta water or more, 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil (plus more for garnish) salt and pepper, to taste

-Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook linguine al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before straining.

-Combine eggs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a medium bowl.

-Whisk thoroughly and set aside.

-Meanwhile, cook bacon in a cast iron skillet on medium heat until fully cooked, remove from the skillet and place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Keep 1-2 tablespoons of bacon grease in the skillet and discard the rest.

-Add minced garlic and sliced chicken to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper and cook until chicken is fully cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.

-Return bacon to the skillet, add the warm linguine and toss with chicken and bacon. Turn the burner down to low and let the skillet cool for 2-3 minutes. If the skillet is too hot you run the risk of scrambling the eggs.

-Add egg mixture to the skillet and toss with the pasta until fully incorporated. Stir in 1/3 c or more of reserved pasta water until creamy.

-Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil
