Do collectives have selfhood?



McDonalds thought: What is McDonalds? And how does the collective intentionality of it work? How does it change under a shift to a cooperative? 
The buildings and people might just be the exact same as it changes, but the collective intentionality and value system changes from profit to potentially satisfying customers as an end initself rather than as an instrumental value for profit maximisation as final value. As such, health, safety, and nice workplaces would be more preferred part of the value system of the McDonalds cooperative.
