    There's roughly a 2500 year history you're asking about here, for both the East and West. But since I'm more knowledgeable on the history of Western logic, I can at least say that Aristotle was probably the first to rigorously formulate a system of logic (a traditional name for his logic is called "syllogistics", but a more modern and general name for it would be "connexive logic"). Then after that you have his students the Peripatetics extending his work, the Megarians / Dialecticians debating about conditionals, then you get the Stoic logicians who were forerunners of what are now called Relevant Logics. Then Boethius who formulated what's now called a Hyperconnexive Logic. The next great period was the middle ages where in the earlier stages you get logicians like Abelard who greatly extended the earlier work on connexive logics and also various people like Alberic of Paris and Adam of Balsham who criticized his work. Later on you have people like John Buridan, Paul of Venice, etc. who set up early systems of what's now called strict implication. Later on in the 19th-century of course is when you get the rise of symbolic logic and what's now called "classical logic" with people like Charles Sanders Peirce and Gottlob Frege; and in the early 20th-century that really flourished especially with the work of Russell & Whitehead at first, then especially a bit later with the work of people like Godel and Tarski. At that time there was also early examples of so-called "non-classical logics" (especially intuitionistic and minimal logic), but these really started becoming more prominent starting in the second half of that century. Nowadays there are all sorts of logics that are investigated and used for many different purposes

    But that's just a very brief overview (and of course I'm just an autodidact, so this is just stuff I've gleaned from my own reading. Those more knowledgeable would definitely have more to offer!). An excellent general overview of course is Kneale & Kneale's _The Development of Logic_. There's also Routley's history of sociative logics I mentioned in this message above ‚Å†üéì„Éªlogic-history‚Å† A less well-known text I also really like is _Language and Logic in the Post-Medieval Period_ by E.J. Ashworth
