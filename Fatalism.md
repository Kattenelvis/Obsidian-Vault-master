Necessetarianism: There exists only one possible world, which is the actual world.
1. $p \rightarrow \square p$
2. $\neg p \rightarrow \square \neg p$

Deterministic Natural laws: Updates the state of the universe over time based on unchaning rules. Let $U_t$ be the state of the universe at time $t$:
1. Discrete: $f(U_t) = U_{t+1}$
2. Continuous: $\frac{dU}{dt}=f(U)$

 With some initial condition (the initial state of the universe) $U_0$. It is deterministic because $\square (f(U_t) = U_{t+1})$.

Thesis 1: Deterministic natural laws do not imply necessetarianism since the initial conditions and natural laws could still have been different. 
$f(U_t) = U_{t+1} \nrightarrow \square (f(U_t) = U_{t+1})$

Likewise, necessetarianism does not imply natural law determinism. The state of the universe at every time step could have been designed by an subject with free actions, or it is neccessarily the case that the
