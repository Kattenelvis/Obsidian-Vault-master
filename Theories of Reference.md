Craig has published on the challenge posed by [platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism "Platonism") to [divine aseity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_aseity "Divine aseity") or self-existence.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTECraig2014-104)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTECraig2016-11)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTECraig2017-105) Craig rejects both the view that God creates [abstract objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_objects "Abstract objects") and that they exist independently of God.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorelandCraig2003506%E2%80%93507-106) Rather, he defends a [nominalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism "Nominalism") perspective that abstract objects are not ontologically real objects.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTECraig2012a-107) Stating that the [Quine–Putnam indispensability argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93Putnam_indispensability_argument "Quine–Putnam indispensability argument") is the chief support of platonism,[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTELiggins2008-108) Craig criticizes the neo-Quinean criterion of ontological commitment, according to which the existential quantifier of first order logic and singular terms are devices of ontological commitment.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-109)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-110)

Craig favors a neutral interpretation of the quantifiers of [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), so that a statement can be true, even if there isn't an object being quantified over. Moreover, he defends a deflationary theory of reference based on the intentionality of agents, so that a person can successfully refer to something even in the absence of some extra-mental thing. Craig gives the example of the statement “the price of the ticket is ten dollars” which he argues can still be a true statement even if there isn't an actual object called a “price.”[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTECraig2012b-111) He defines these references as a [speech act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act "Speech act") rather than a word-world relation, so that singular terms may be used in true sentences without commitment to corresponding objects in the world.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTEB%C3%A5ve2009-112) Craig has additionally argued that even if one were to grant that these references were being used as in a word-world relation, that [fictionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictionalism "Fictionalism") is a viable explanation of their use; in particular pretense theory, according to which statements about abstract objects are expressions of make-believe, imagined to be true, even if literally false.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicholsStich1999-113)"
