Comment from Phyrro:

- To expand on my claim I prefer the term _eliminativist_ to "eliminative materialist," this is because I take eliminativists to be broadly committed to two theses,
    
    1. The theory-theory (hereby referred to as the TT): lay psychology comprises a theory of the mental and this theory can be true or false (or roughly true, e.g. with verisimilitude). I will refer to this purported theory as the _lay theory._,
    2. Eliminative theory-change: many concepts that feature in the lay theory will be eliminated in better theories of the mind and/or do not feature in an ideal theory of the mind; the folk theory is profoundly and ineliminably wrong about the mental.,
    
    A commitment to physicalism and/or a materialism-esque position does not appear in either thesis. To wit, it is mistaken to consider eliminativism to be a physicalist or materialist position. It also does not require one be a scientific realist; some scientific anti-realists may take the latter conjunct of (2). Stated as such, it is controversial and unclear eliminativists accept both (1) and (2), e.g. connectionists such as Bill Ramsey. However, my usage of the term "theory" is liberal---I believe that with this in mind, the theses above are uncontroversial among eliminativists. In addition, while fictionalists will accept part of (2), that is that the folk theory is ineliminably wrong about the mental, we should not do away with it.

    The TT is controversial but is accepted by many non-eliminativists such as David Lewis and non-philosophers. There are two senses of the TT which are commonly conflated: TT in the sense of developmental psychology (hereby referred to as the developmental TT or DTT), whereby infants learn about and make predictions about other and/or their own minds by developing what is effectively a scientific theory and TT in the sense above. While the DTT has rich scientific support, it is easily challenged; simulation theorists challenge the DTT, arguing that theory of mind develops out of the brain's attempts to simulate other minds; simulation theory also sees rich face value appeal, e.g. in lay accounts of empathizing or mental theorizing ("stepping in another's shoes") or in the well-documented activity of mirror neurons in mammalian empathizing and theory-of-mind behavior. TT is _not_ the DTT and one can reject the DTT while accepting the TT or vice-versa. To see why, we will follow Lewis in "Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications" (1972). The original context of the paper is in expounding upon Lewis' "How to Define Theoretical Terms" (1970) and developing further his analytic functionalism. Lewis sketches out a basic theory of Ramsification with which we are not concerned. Rather, we are only concerned with Lewis' observation that, given a set of theses about mental states (_T-terms_) and their relationship to non-mental things, e.g. motor responses (_O-terms_), one can consider these theses as comprising _postulates_ of a theory of the mind (regardless of whether this is how it is internally conceptualized to the user). Our ability to do this remains regardless of how the postulates are discovered, and the postulates take the role of a predictive apparatus in any case.

    Taking the primary rival theory of the DTT, the simulation theory, as an example, an infant may begin to develop beliefs about another human's behavior by simulating (modeling) their brain, with the simulation being determined by that infant's prior beliefs about that person. Under the simulation theory, I may infer how someone will feel if they are yelled at by internally simulating a scenario where I am yelled at and collecting the relevant results, such as emotions, beliefs, or desires. Nonetheless, I will still hold _some beliefs_ about how terms like "_X_ desires _Y_," "_X_ believes _Y_," or "_X_ feels pain" relate to non-mental concepts like motor responses or the production of tears in the lacrimal glands. By analogy, we may not develop beliefs about the world through testing and theorizing, but it needn't follow that our beliefs are _not_ theories carrying theoretical baggage.

    Bearing in mind the above, it is clear eliminativism is a very broad and minimal thesis. A philosopher would be an eliminativist, for instance, if she denied beliefs would feature in an ideal theory of the mind. The "radical" appearance of eliminativism arises from the fact that a vocal minority of eliminativists are also sympathetic to _illusionism_, which is a subset of eliminativism whereby terms such as "consciousness" and "experience" will not feature in an ideal theory and our conviction in them shall be explained away. The dispositions that motivate eliminativism are the same dispositions that motivate a commitment to physicalism or to illusionism, which is why the two theories are often conflated. A key related idea is that of _anti-exceptionalism about the phenomenal_ or _AEP_ (which I took from the non-analogous anti-exceptionalism about logic / AEL).

    AEP theorists deny many of the commonly accepted "exceptional" properties of phenomenal experiences such as the ineffable "what is it like"-ness of Frank Jackson (whom the modern usage of qualia is due). I will be using "quale" in the broad sense of a property of a phenomenal experience. In terms of _qualia theory_, qualia correspond to a specific kind of qualia which is non-representational, immediate, intrinsic, and non-relational. This view can be thought of as a successor to the now-unpopular sense-datum theory. Dennett outlines a few key principles of qualia in this sense:
    
    - Qualia are _ineffable_,,
    - Qualia are _private_,,
    - Qualia are _immediate_*,
    - Qualia are _non-relational_,
    
    To account for the fact I am construing qualia widely, I will add that
    
    - Qualia are _non-representational_,
    
6. _[_23:23_]_
    
    AEP theorists deny at least one of the above principles of qualia. Almost all of these are widely challenged. For instance, representationalism is currently the plurality view among philosophers according to PhilSurvey 2020; non-relationalism about qualia is frequently challenged by naive realists; the privacy of qualia is challenged by many eliminativists. Many eliminativists are AEP theorists, since qualia construed as exceptional runs the trouble of comporting with materialist approaches to the mind (which are admittedly one of the main motivations for eliminativism, hence the popular name "material eliminativism"), but one does not have to be an AEP theorist to be an eliminativist. Some AEP theorists may further hold that we must take to task explaining why people report their experiences satisfy the above "exceptional" properties. In Frankish's terminology, these people would be _weak illusionists,_ e.g. Peter Carruthers on visual perception. These folk usually also deny that qualia are immediate, since they must explain why we are consistently _wrong_ about our experiences.

    Returning to illusionism, I think it is important to motivate illusionism in the nominal sense that most illusionists claim to support: there are no phenomenal qualities. Typically, the style of argument goes like thus
    
    1. Phenomenal qualities are such that they must jointly hold properties _P1_, _P2_, ..., _Pn_,
    2. There is nothing that jointly hold properties _P1_, _P2_, ..., _Pn_,
    3. Therefore, there are no phenomenal properties.,
    
    To see an instance of this, Frankish gives the following argument (which I have rephrased into premise-by-premise form) to motivate illusionism:
    
    4. Phenomenal qualities are such that they must be non-physical but bring about causal effects,
    5. Nothing can be both non-physical and bring about causal effects,
    6. Therefore, there are no phenomenal qualities,
    
    Frankish defends the above by arguing that either (1) holds or so-called "conservative realism" must hold, but conservative realism does not hold, so (1) must hold. Frankish defends (2) by appealing to the fact that the physical world appears to be causally closed, viz. nothing outside it causes any effects within it or vice versa. The way to conceptualize Frankish's position is that, in fact, qualia _is_ exceptional in the above sense and as a result it does not exist. "Conservative realists," in the sense of Frankish, correspond to AEP theorists who claim that qualia is unexceptional in such a sense as to comport with current physical theories and do not require radical non-physical commitments.

    By far the biggest difficulty in understanding and defending illusionism is offering an adequate account of introspection. The paradox is as follows: if phenomenal experience is illusory, as in the analogy of telekinesis and the appearance of mental powers, what are the illusions? The illusionist is faced with a dilemma: either accept that the illusion is itself an experience or accept that the illusion itself is illusory. The first disjunct seems to imply illusionism is self-defeating and the latter disjunct offers an undesirable infinite regress. The paradox is made no clearer than using Frankish's own words: "Illusionists deny that experiences have phenomenal properties and focus on explaining why they _seem_ to have them" (italics added). Either "seeming to have a phenomenal property" is a phenomenal property or it is not. If it is, then it is not true that no experience has a phenomenal property. If it is not, it is unclear what the illusionist is really denying. However, not all seemings (or ways thing seem) manifestly pertain to phenomenal experience or phenomenal properties. Beliefs or other intentional content may appear even with the lack of phenomenal experience or "consciousness," e.g. potentially in automated deduction systems or LLMs. So it may be that what Frankish is saying is that it is the task of the illusionist to explain why we report and believe that our experiences have phenomenal properties, but our beliefs themselves do not correspond to any phenomenal experience. It is easy to motivate this view. When one says "it seems I am seeing the color red," a simple reading is that she is saying that her phenomenal experiences are that of a situation in which she were seeing the color red, or, her experiences represent a red object. Whereas when one says "it seems to me that the conjecture is true," it is not clear that she is reporting upon any distinct experience or phenomenal character. Instead, she is making a doxastic claim.

    So what about me? Well, I am closest to Keith Frankish in terms of what I believe, though I do not agree with his nomenclatural positions. Here is a brief summary of the views I share with Keith Frankish:
    
    - We have experiences,
    - These experiences have properties,
    - We are consistently wrong on the nature of our experiences,
    - Experiences are not ineffable, private, immediate, nor non-physical,
    - Many of the concepts that feature in a lay theory of the mind are inadequate and should be eliminated,
    - There is no "what is it like"-ness property associated with experiences, that is, experiences do not have phenomenal properties in the sense of Frankish,
    
10. _[_23:24_]_
    
    Most of my views arise out of the fact that I think a theory of mind should be subservient to an adequate theory of the physical phenomena underpinning brains. I do not think there is anything to say about minds beyond what can be said about brains. We may be able to draw functional and structural analogues in deductive reasoning systems, or many mammalian brains, or cognitive systems that evolved in different environments, in the same way one can do this for biological systems, but I do not think this is anything more than identifying similar function and behavior. For instance, there is no _elàn vital_ to provide a "biological dimension" of the world or "biological laws." As I do not think there is anything that experiences "are like" (though I do not deny experiences), I do not think two identically functioning brains will have the same qualia (in the sense of phenomenal quality or what-is-it-likeness), since there are no phenomenal qualities at all.
    
11. _[_23:24_]_
    
    As mentioned before, the biggest difficulty in conceptualizing and developing an illusionist project is in accounting for the nature of introspection. I take introspection to be the process whereby we come to understand our own experiences, dispositions, behaviors, and properties (e.g. what beliefs we hold). In this broad sense, it is uncontroversial introspection is sometimes unreliable (for instance, we are very bad at keeping track of our own bodily movements or subtle habits). However, I am also concerned with introspection in the narrow sense where we come to develop beliefs about our own experiences. I think this is by-and-large not a reliable process. The simplest motivation for this comes from observation that the brain is a massively parallel system (see chiefly the work of Semir Zeki). There is no unified consciousness whereby all the information is collated into one singular "sense of experience." So it is not shocking that we are unable to reliably report upon what our experiences are, because there is no singular sense of experience in the first place, much less a finalized collection of all stimuli.
