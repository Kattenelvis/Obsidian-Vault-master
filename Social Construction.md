I found our discussion on sexuality interesting and while I was zoning out I was developing a more advanced theory of heterosexuality and how to generalize that theory to all sexualities and all genders, while also showing that it is not a social construction (in a way money is). I might not have delved too deeply into the social constructivism debate, so I might be wrong, feel free to point that out!

In this essay I will argue that while money is a social construction as it is a game-theoretic Nash equilibrium state, sexuality is not a social construction as it is not game-theoretic but rather has a basis with neurophysiology and biophenomenology. 

To simplify the mathematics for now we assume there's only two genders (👩|👨) and that someone is either non-attracted (😐) or attracted (🔥) (but this could in theory be generalized to $m$ genders, with $2^m$ sexualities as a consequence). Let $E_i$ be a set of stimulus events containing either a man or a woman.  Let the table below be a finite number of observations made by an heterosexual male.

|Event|E_1|E_2|E_3|E_4|$\dots$|E_n|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Gender of stimulus|👩|👨|👩|👨|$\dots$|👩
|Phenomenology|🔥|😐|🔥|😐|$\dots$|🔥

One can then create an inductive inference from this set of events into a generalized hypothesis. Let $M$ mean man, $W$ mean woman, and $A$ mean attracted too. We can take the inductive inference to be the following [SEP page on Formal learning theory]:  $(M(a)\rightarrow\forall x (W(x)\rightarrow A(a,x)\wedge M(x)\rightarrow\neg A(a,x)))\wedge (W(a)\rightarrow \forall x (W(x)\rightarrow A(a,x)\wedge M(x)\rightarrow\neg A(a,x)))$
Simply: If $a$ is man, then $a$ is attracted to all women and no men. If $a$ is a woman, then $a$ is attracted to all men and no women. Since it gives us the truth conditions for whether or not $a$ is straight, we can take this to be the meaning of "$a$ is straight". This also roughly captures the usage of the term, though one can always create explicative definitions of it and analyze them individually. I don't wanna get into the descriptivism vs prescriptivism debate in the philosophy of language though. 

But of course, the occasional opposite sex stimulus does not provoke a fiery response, and the rare same-sex attraction under certain circumstances aswell, so one can instead use the generalized quantifier "most" instead of "for all" [See SEP page on generalized quantifiers] (note that the 👩 stimulus is no longer provoking 🔥response)

|Event|E_1|E_2|E_3|E_4|$\dots$|E_n|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Gender of stimulus|👩|👨|👩|👨|$\dots$|👩
|Phenomenology|🔥|😐|🔥|😐|$\dots$|😐

Which gives us the revised meaning of straight as
$(M(a)\rightarrow \textbf{most}(x) (W(x)\rightarrow A(a,x)\wedge M(x)\rightarrow\neg A(a,x)))\wedge (W(a)\rightarrow \textbf{most}(x) (W(x)\rightarrow A(a,x)\wedge M(x)\rightarrow\neg A(a,x)))$
Which gives us the roughly correct truth conditions for "a is straight".

We will now connect this with biophenomenology, the study of how biology and phenomenology interact [Source Daniel Dennett here or something]. The earlier pattern can now be redescribed using physical objects instead of mental objects, given research done on sexuality [insert neurophysiology of sexuality study here].

|Event|E_1|E_2|E_3|E_4|$\dots$|E_n|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Stimulus Pattern|👩|👨|👩|👨|$\dots$|👩
|Cortex Response|🔥|😐|🔥|😐|$\dots$|🔥

With similar truth conditions as before, but with slightly different predicates (physical predicates instead of mental predicates), this gives us the same truth conditions, if identity theory of mind is true. 

Now for money. Certain game-theoretic equilibrium states, such as a Nash equilibrium, sets agents in a position where changing any of their options would lead to a worse outcomes for themselves. This doesn't mean this is a stable state to be in, as certain coordination attempts by all players can lead to a different equilibrium spot. Perhaps towards a Kantian equilibrium [SEP page on analytic marxism].

Money is something in which there's a Nash equilibrium if everyone believes it is valuable. If one single individual does it, it is no longer benefitial. Let's say Alice is a rebel and no will no longer use money. You can see in the payout table that

|Alice/Society|Use money|Not use money|
|-|-|-|
|Use money|5/90|0/-50|
|Not use money|0/90|10/-50|

Alice has a lot of incentive to switch over to using money, despite her being better off in a society without money, even though society is worse off. So it's important to note that this has a social basis, and no biological basis. The neurophysiology of all member of society, including Alice, likely has a very low effect on the value of money, or the neurons responsible for it are atleast easily reconfigurable. This paper has a more comprehensive theory of games in societies, which also incorporates sociological theories of games [The theory of social games: outline of a general theory for the social sciences | Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01862-0)

It's potentially already clear why this might not be a social construction, but let's formulate what a social construction is. From Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy, "If there is any core idea of social constructionism, it is that some object or objects are caused or controlled by social or cultural factors rather than natural factors, and if there is any core motivation of such research, it is the aim of showing that such objects are or were under our control: they could be, or might have been, otherwise.". 

Since cortex responses and stimulus patterns are natural factors and not social factors, in the way money is for instance, then sexuality is not a social construction while money is.

This doesn't mean this is a stable state to be in, as certain coordination attempts by all players can lead to a different equilbrium spot.

But to clarify why I believe this is a good charactirization of social construction, imagine money. Money as a good is something in which there's a nash eqilibrium if everoyne believes it is valuable. If one single individual does it, it is no longer benefitial. Let's say Alice is a rebel and no will no longer use money. You can see in the payout table that

|Alice/Society|Use money|Not use money|
|-|-|-|
|Use money|5/90|0/-50|
|Not use money|0/90|0/-50|

Alice has a lot of incentive to switch over to using money. So it's important to note that this has a social basis, and no biological basis. The neurophysiology of all member of society, including Alice, likely has no bearing on the value of money. 

Now let's compare this to whether or not society will be using the concept straight 

|Alice/Society|Use straight|Not use straight|
|-|-|-|
|Use straight|0/0|0/0|
|Not use straight|0/0|0/0|






Oh almost forgot! Here's how to generalize it to $m$ genders and get $2^m$ sexualities.

$1$ gender, $2^1=2$ sexualities:
Asexual
Homosexual

$2$ genders, $2^2=4$ sexualities:
Asexual
Homosexual
Hetereosexual
Bisexual

$3$ genders, $2^3=8$ sexualities:
Asexual

3 types of hetero/homosexual:
Attracted to gender 1
Attracted to gender 2
Attracted to gender 3

3 types of bisexuality:
Attracted to gender 1 and 2
