# Epistemology of Testimony:

Reductionism - Testimonial knowledge is reducible to say, perception memory and induction

Anti-Reductionism - Testimonial knowledge is a basic justification

AI testimony: If testimony is some kind of speech act then no. Some argue yes. 


# Peer disagreement

Conciliationism - Decreased credence in $p$ whenever there's peer disagreement about $p$
"The most demanding version of Conciliationism is the Equal Weight View, according to which one ought to assign equal weight to a peer’s opinion as to one’s own"

"Critics of conciliationism offer a number of objections. One presents a charge of self-refutation: since conciliationism itself is a widely-disputed claim, it follows (given conciliation) that if conciliationism is true, we are not in a position to rationally believe it. (For further discussion, see Christensen 2013.)"

"A second criticism derives from the “right reasons” view of Kelly (2005). Suppose that after all evidence has been disclosed two peers continue to disagree over whether interests rates will rise. Since the fact of disagreement itself is not evidence bearing on whether interest rates will rise, it is irrelevant to what one should believe regarding whether interest rates will rise. For this very reason, learning of a peer disagreement should not affect one’s confidence on this topic at all. Rather, what rationality requires here is what rationality requires everywhere: belief in accordance with the relevant evidence. (Titelbaum (2015) offers a version of this argument restricted to the domain of beliefs regarding the norms of rationality themselves.)"

"Lackey (2010) develops a similar “justificationist” position about peer disagreement. According to her view, what rationality requires in a case of peer disagreement is determined by what one’s total evidence supports _after_ one adds the evidence one acquires in the disagreement itself. In some cases, she argues, one’s (post-disagreement) total evidence will require a significant change in one’s degree of confidence, in other cases it will require no change at all, and in still other cases it will require something in between. As we will see, these positions are roughly consistent with more formal, Bayesian approaches to updating beliefs on the credences of others."


# Group Belief

Summativism: $B(p) \leftrightarrow B_{a_1}(p)\wedge\dots B_{a_n}(p)$

Anti-Summativism: No

Doctors update beliefs using Bayes' formula comparing two treatments at 0.499 vs 0.501

Does the community converge? Maybe not.

![[Pasted image 20241203164151.png]]> But notice that a bigger community is more likely to find the truth too. Why? Because bigger, less connected networks are better insulated against misleading results.

Polarization when there's some degree of misstrust

For a different formal approach to polarization, see Dorst (2020, Other Internet Resources). For other work on network epistemology see Zollman (2013) and [§4.3 of the entry on social epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-social/#NetwEpisMode), and the references therein.

Other formal projects in social epistemology include work on the relationship between social and individual rationality (Mayo-Wilson, Zollman, and Danks 2011); on judgment aggregation/opinion pooling (Genest and Zidek 1986; List and Pettit 2002; Russell, Hawthorne, and Buchak 2015); on learning from the beliefs of others (Easwaran _et al_ 2016; Bradley 2018); and on the social benefits of competing update rules, such as Conditionalization vs. Inference to the Best Explanation (Douven and Wenmackers 2017; Pettigrew m.s., Other Internet Resources).
