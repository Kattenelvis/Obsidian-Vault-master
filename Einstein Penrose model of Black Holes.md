A superintelligent AI might take the risk at sending two probes through a black hole to try to keep working in parallell universes. There can be no contact between the main AGI and the probes (any information attempted to leave the black hole will continue in towards the black hole as the singularity is always in the path of any object going through it) 

The probe might be completely scattered though.
