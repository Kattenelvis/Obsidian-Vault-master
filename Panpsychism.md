Multiple smaller consciousness that make up a rock:
\[\] \[\] \[\] \[\] \[\]
One unified consciousness because of a global workspace/integrated information e.t.c
\[               \]


Every empirical object in the universe may have an internal experience. Hallucinations are just a subset of one internal experience that does not have an internal experience.

Idea: Look up how the continuity argument "interacts with" the tabular rasa argument. Inspired by NARS.

Idea: Every material model has an ideal isomorphism.
Example:
Two objects are drifting a part over time
\[ \]   \[ \] --> 

Which ideal model is informationally equvalent?
The experience of a color getting darker which is related to the distance of the two objects


"Real physicalism, then, must accept that experiential phenomena are physical phenomena. But how can experiential phenomena be physical phenomena? Many take this claim to be profoundly problematic (this is the ‘mind–body problem’)."
Strawson 2006



"Constitutive panpsychism is the thesis that macrophenomenal truths are (wholly or partially) grounded in microphenomenal truths. Nonconstitutive panpsychism is the thesis that macrophenomenal truths are not grounded in microphenomenal truths. The most important form of nonconstitutive panpsychism is emergent panpsychism, on which macrophenomenal properties are strongly emergent from microphenomenal or microphysical properties, perhaps in virtue of fundamental laws connecting microphenomenal to macrophenomenal."
(Chalmers, https://consc.net/papers/combination.pdf)

"The combination problem can be broken down into at least three subproblems, reflecting three different aspects of phenomenal states: their subjective character (they are always had by a subject), their qualitative character (they involve distinctive qualities), and their structural character (they have a certain complex structure). These three aspects yield what we might call the subject combination problem, the quality combination problem, and the structure combination problem"

From another book:
"First, anti-combination has a long and prominent history in the form of what is sometimes called the “Achilles” argument, so christened by Kant (1997, A351) for being the strongest argument of its kind. The argument maintains that because “representations that are divided among different beings . . . never constitute a whole thought” (A353), conscious minds must be simple and without parts, and therefore cannot be material. Versions of this Achilles argument appear in authors stretching from Plotinus (1956, 255–258, 342–356) to Brentano (1987, 290–301).6 And for these authors, since physical things are always divisible, the indivisibility of conscious minds proves that they lie outside the physical world." How to think about composite subjectivity.

"An especially pressing aspect of the structure combination problem is the structural mismatch problem. Macrophysical structure (in the brain, say) seems entirely different from the macrophenomenal structure we experience. Microexperiences presumably have structure closely corresponding to microphysical structure (this is especially clear on a Russellian view), and we might expect a combination of them to yield something akin to macrophysical structure. How do these combine to yield macrophenomenal structure instead? There are a few other aspects of the combination problem, corresponding to different aspects of macroexperience that need explaining. There is the unity problem: how do microexperiences come together to yield a unified consciousness? There is the boundary problem (Rosenberg 1998): how do microexperiences come together to yield a bounded consciousness? There is the awareness problem: how do microexperiences come together to yield awareness of qualities? And there is the grain problem (Maxwell 1979; Lockwood 1993): how do microexperiences come together to yield homogeneous macroexperiences, such as a homogeneous experience of red, instead of an enormous jagged array of distinct qualities? Some of these problems might be assimilated to earlier problems (the first three plausibly involve aspects of subjective character, the last involves an aspect of qualitative character, and all involve aspects of structure), but it is useful to have them on the table explicitly"

"However, constitutive panpsychism is not committed to the claim that macroexperience is wholly grounded in microexperience. It could be partly grounded in causal or structural relations among the microexperiences, or in other microphysical properties, or even in other quiddities if there are non-phenomenal quiddities as well."


Idea: If the hypergraph generates a space-time structure, and each hypergraph node/hyperedge is a microphenomenal property aswell as a microphysical property, then physicalist panpsychism or perhaps Russelian Monism is what DP is. Phenomena and Counsciousness would then be placed in 4D spacetime (or atleast, if Presentism is true, a 3D slice/hypersurface of spacetime), not "flat" or the visualization I did earlier with all subjects next to eachother and divided arbitrarily. 

This solves some problems of combinations and speration, just as what Chalmers talks about. Subjects are seperated causally, speed of light puts limits to causality. 



Idea: Assume Russeliean Monism. When two particles are entangled, two quiddites are entangled. Then the phenomenal properties of one quiddite might depend on the other. 

Entangled state between two quiddites 
$\alpha \ket{1} + \beta\ket{0}$ 



Idea: Sepration problem, the idea that panspychism cannot explain the separation of subjects (singular animal beings separated from another animal e.t.c). 
Why is this a problem?
Powerset of $U = 2^U$ 
Each subject $s\in 2^U$ is arbitrarily picked from the powerset of the universal experience
But what about $2^{2^U}$ ? That must also be a subject, ad infinitum. 
Alternatively, only  $s\in U$ is a subject in which case every subject is just a FSM which contradicts experience.

Collective Intentionality
Collective Emotions
Collective Phenomenology

"I believe that it is primarily anti-combination that explains this intuitive resistance to the idea of collective consciousness, and in particular the discrepancy in attitudes toward collective intentionality and collective consciousness. People generally want to avoid irreducible, emergent group minds which float above individual minds; such beings seem mysterious, unparsimonious, and even ethically threatening (Searle 1990, 404; List and Pettit 2011, 9)."

Constituative Russellian Panpsychism and conscious combination:
"If the fundamental things are something else—waves, fields, strings, spacetime, or the universe as a whole—then panpsychism says correspondingly that those have some rudimentary glimmer of consciousness. It does not automatically follow that “everything” is conscious, for many things (shoes, ships, sealing wax, etc.) are nonfundamental, built up out of the basic constituents. Whether those composite things are conscious will depend on exactly how consciousness combines."

Four Arguments

1. Explanatory argument, i.e why reductive physicalism is cringe 
   
   "By “naturalism” I mean the view that the world contains a single basic type of stuff, whose behavior is governed by a single set of simple, general laws, and that these laws are those revealed by science. "
   
   Psychophysical laws to connect the physical and mental processes. So far, according to panpsychists, this has been unsatisfyingly ad hoc and their scope has been way more narrow compared to the generality of physical laws. 

2. Intrinsic natures argument, i.e everything in naturalism but panpsychism is cringe
   
   (1) Properties described by physics are merely structural
   (2) Mental properties are the only properties not merely structural
   (3) Structural properties must be instantiated by something non-structural 
   
 "all the fundamental properties ascribed by physics—force, energy, mass, charge, etc.—are defined by their place in equations linking them to other such properties."
   
   "The intrinsic natures argument then proceeds as follows. Even if physics does not tell us what physical properties really are in themselves—even if it does not tell us their “intrinsic natures”—they must still be something. The structure physics reveals must be implemented in something. So what could this something be—what are the intrinsic natures of physical properties? Experiential properties are one candidate: maybe what we call “mass” is a certain kind of experience, whose characteristic effects and distribution are captured by the equations of physics. Or perhaps the intrinsic natures of physical properties are something completely inconceivable to us, something of which we neither have nor can form any positive conception—call this the “noumenalist” option, borrowing Kant’s term for the forever-unknown way things are in themselves (Goff 2017a, 170). The panpsychist claims that these are the only two options, and that we should prefer the first option, which implies panpsychism. Why should we prefer it? Partly, perhaps, because it is unreasonably defeatist to adopt a noumenalist position when a more positive view is available. But also, partly, because noumenalism is unparsimonious. Some parts of the material world have conscious experience as their intrinsic nature—namely, human brain processes. So the noumenalist position, which says that some matter has one nature and other matter has a different nature, seems to be needlessly multiplying the number of basic types in the world. Hence Occam’s razor cuts against it."

3. Causal exclusion argument, i.e Dualism is cringe.
   
 "Third, the causal exclusion argument for panpsychism (closely analogous to a similarly named argument for physicalism) says that because consciousness seems to have power to affect the physical world, and because events in the physical world seem to be entirely driven by the causal powers of physical things, consciousness must be some part of the physical world"

4. Continuitity argument. Chalmers:
   " panspychism avoid[s] the need for consciousness to ‘wink in’ at a certain level of complexity . . . [because] any specific point seems arbitrary, so a theory that avoids having to make this decision gains a certain simplicity.”


Constituative (combinational) and Emergenstist (non-combination since macroexperience is a strong emergent object from either microexperience or microphysics)

Russellian (laws of physics describe the causal structure of experiential properties) and Dualist (physical ultimates have physical and experiential properties). 
Both Causal and Intrinsic natures argument implies Russelianism
Idea: Formalise that into logic

"It is very natural to think that my “field of experience” (the totality of what I am conscious of at a given moment) can be divided into components, such as my present total visual experience, which is a part distinct from my present auditory or olfactory or emotional experiences. It seems equally unobjectionable to divide my total visual experience into component experiences, like my experience of some particular visible object (e.g., my coffee cup). But while these component experiences might be called “parts of my consciousness,” they are not themselves parts of me, the subject, because they are not themselves conscious in the way that I am."




"the URT (Unified Reality Theory) of Steven Kaufman and the CTMU (Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe) by Chris Langan bring digital physics and panpsychism together in a surprising manner"
