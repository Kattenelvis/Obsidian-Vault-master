Me writing a paper yippiie!


The idea: 

According to the Jury theorem, assuming that we use a voting system where we either vote  yes or no to some question based on if we believe if it's true or not, and we use majority voting, and we have no method of tie breaking, then the following is the case:

**Increased Reliability:** For any odd number of individuals in that group, if you add two more individuals the probability that the group votes on ground truth increases.

**Crowd Infallibility:** As the number of individuals in that group approaches infinity, the probability that the group votes on ground truth approach 100%. 

However, according to a modified version, based on Reichenbach's common cause principle, assuming everyone votes at once, if individuals who vote are systematically misinformed from some common source, then the crowd infallibility is going to be locked at a max level proportional to the amount of misinformation in the system.

If generative AI systems is a common source of misinformation, that systematically misinforms voters, then this is a threat to the epistemic performance of democracy. As a consequence, democracy becomes an increasingly worse system in comparison to various well-informed technocratic societies which are worse than a well-informed democratic system. 

While common sources of misinformation already exist now, the automated process of AI systems can lead to a rapid increase in the propagation of misinformation as humans are no longer needed in the loop to spread misinformation on a societal scale.

Prediction markets may be one way to diminish the risk, as there will be stronger incentives to be less missinformed. Liquid democracy allows for an elite of informed individuals, while not compromising democracy.

"List and Goodin (2001) importantly generalize Theorem 2s infallibility conclu sion to the case of k 2 options, still assuming one option is correct. They generalize CC: given the correct option x, a voter is more likely to vote for x than for y, and this for every incorrect option y. Interestingly, the probability of correct voting no longer needs to exceed 1/2 for k > 2 options. It can be conjectured that the growing-reliability conclusion also generalizes to k 2 options. The upshot is that jury theorems and wisdom of crowds arguments need not be restricted to binary decision problems."

"Going beyond majority voting, some work asks which voting rule is epistemically optimal, where optimality could be cashed out di erently, e.g., by maximizing the probability of a correct outcome (e.g., Nitzan and Paroush 1982, Shapley and Grof man 1984, Ben-Yashar and Nitzan 1997, Dietrich 2006, Pivato 2013). The generic nding is that, under an independence axiom of type UI or CI, the optimal rule is a weighted super-, sub- or simple majority rule in which a voters weight is a well de ned function of his competence (and becomes negative in case of incompetence). Simple majority rule is optimal in case of equal competence and symmetric options"
