Let's say there's an agent $A$ whose beliefs involve believing in $p$ by 0.6 and $\neg p$ by 0.6. A Dutch bookie can set up a betting situation where $A$ is made to pay $0.6$ for $p$ for the chance to win $\$1$ and also $0.6$ for $\neg p$ for the same price money. Then $A$ will loose $\$ 1.2$ but can only win $\$1$, hence $A$ will always loose the bet.

## i.

By the transitivity of preferences, we take it that the $BC$ lottery is equivalent to the $BD$ lottery. Since, compared to the $BC$ lottery, I'm willing to give up some probability of $B$ for an increased probability in $D$ while they remain equivalent, I prefer $D$ over $C$. 
## ii.

We define an utility function $U$ and we have it that:
$0.7 U(B) + 0.3 U(C) = 0.55 U(B) + 0.45 U(D)$

$0.15 U(B) =  0.45 U(D) - 0.3 U(C)$

$0.15 U(B) =  0.45 U(D) - 0.3 U(C)$

$U(B) =  3 U(D) - 2 U(C)$


## iii.

$1 =  3 U(D)$

$B > C$ and $C> D$


$U(C) = \frac{1}{3}U(B) + \frac{2}{3}U(D)$

$3U(C) = U(B) + 2U(D)$

## a.

Expected monetary value: 

$10\times 2/5 + 50\times 3/5 = 34$

Expected utility:

$U(10)\times 2/5 + U(50)\times 3/5 = 4.4$

## b.

Since the marginal utility decreases as the amount of money increases, the risk attitude expressed by the utility function is risk-aversion.

Since the utilities don't match up, i.e 
$U(A)/4 + U(B)3/4 = 3.75\neq 4$, it violates atleast one axiom by the Von-Neumann Morgenstern theorem.

We know that they do not violate the transitivity axiom nor continuity for there aren't even 3 or more preferences to compare. We know that it does not violate completeness because all preferences are comparable (here, assigned to numbers). Hence it must violate the independence axiom.

Transitivity holds because given that B \leq L1 and L1\leq A, and also that B\leq A. We also have completeness. In fact, both trivially hold for utility functions. 

All continuity says is that such a probability exists. 

pA + (1-p)B = L1

p6 + (1-p)3 = 4

p6 + 3 - 3p = 4

3p = 1

p=1/3

So this preference ordering does not violate continuity. 

Hence it must violate independence.
