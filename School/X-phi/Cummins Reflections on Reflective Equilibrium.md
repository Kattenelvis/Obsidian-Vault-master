The article states that intuitions are similar to observations and that the general principles tested by those intuitions are similar to some inductive inference on those intuitions. The idea is that thinking through philosophical intuitions and forming general concepts and using them to predict one's intuitions on new thought experiments is a lot like forming a scientific theory. One analyses intuitions and forms general principles where those intuitions hold. The idea is to eventually reach a kind of "reflective equilibrium" with one's intuitions and theories.

However the author argues that simple enumerative induction, such as "all swans are white" from a finite set of observed swans is not the way forward in reflective equilibrium, it is rather more complicated then that. But it's similar in nature in that it's about "charting what is known onto the unknown". The author goes over an example of two intuition "experiments" involving principles of fairness among children.

Experiment 1:
(i) Equal amount of coins
(ii) Coins based on how large the children are
(iii) Coins based on how poor they are
(iv) Coins based on one child dividing the coins and then randomly distributing the piles

Where Experiment 2 has coins replaced by jewels. 

So our intuitively based philosophical theories are making predictions where intuition has yet to be applied, where it has not been used to generate the theory. 

However, what should we do when the intuitions are in conflict? Which intuition should be given up and why? Science involving conflicting observations o1 and o2 also have to be resolved in some way, as an artifact or anomaly. The reason this works in science is because science is intersubjective, so whenever some agent A has observation O_A and agent B has observation O_B, then O_A and O_B should agree with their results. The author brings up the rotation of stars in the sky overnight as an example, where O_A=counterclockwise rotation and O_B=clockwise rotation. 

The author however argues that this is not the case in philosophical intuition. In fact, philosophers constantly move on from disputed intuitions and pretend as if they were resolved, where the author brings up the Twin Earth thought experiment as an example of this.

The author makes another comparison to science, and it's about configuring scientific instruments. For instance, when Galileo used a telescope to find mountains on the moon, some people responded that there might be problems with the telescope. Scientists adjust their instruments, but it seems no one is adjusting their philosophical intuitions. Yet for reflective equilibrium to work, we need to resolve our conflicts. We could calibrate our philosophical intuitions however, if there was a non-intuitive way of arriving at the truth.

The author states that intuitions are artifacts, and lists 5 ways philosophical intuitions manifest:

1. Explicit Theory: Philosophical intuitions are the result of applying some explicit theory. Explicit theory states that intuitions are applications of explicit theories such as the theory of gravity as an example in the text, or as perhaps inferring that the reason you got sick was because of a guy sneezing being an intuition inferred to from germ theory (not miasma).  
   
2. Ordinary Beliefs: Philosophical intuitions are, or are direct consequences of, things people simply happen to believe as the result of education, socialization, and the like. Our ordinary beliefs are those that we grow up with from our parents or teachers, perhaps the TV-shows one watched or Websites one has been on. Intuitions formed from ordinary beliefs are highly culturally dependent and cannot be relied upon.
   
3. Language. Philosophical intuitions are, or are generated by, the knowledge base one acquires in acquiring one's language. Perhaps some intitions come from our learning of a language. Such semantic intuitions woulr be similar to grammatical intuitions, who are generally considered to be correct and very similar for most people and not different from experts. 
   
4. Concepts. Philosophical intuitions are generated by concepts.

5. Tacit Theory. Philosophical intuitions are the result of applying some tacit/implicit theory that we hold, and try to explicate it via an explicit theory, as per the image below

However it might be the case that innate ideas are evolutionarily adaptive, and hence may not be entirely reliable. Some may argue that increasing reliability increases probability of survival, but that's not necessarily.
