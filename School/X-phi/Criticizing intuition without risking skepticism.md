There are two problems for arguments against intuitions. The first one is: how do you avoid criticizing so much intuition that you end up with a self-defeat where such intuitions one aims at criticizing are also needed to justify the criticism in the first place. Another problem is ending up criticizing so much that it implies self-defeating skepticism, such as ending up criticizing one's memory, perception and ability to reason along with philosophical intuitions, an philosophical intuition being something which is a seeming, i.e something that appears to be the case. Examples include say Swampman, which is a purported counterexample to Millikan's teleosemantics and Twin Earth thought experiment as a counterexample to semantic internalism. 

So the idea is to have a criterion to separate such that one can criticize philosophical intuitions without reaching skepticism or self-defeat. This is to argue for hopelessness and hopefulness. The author argues that while sense-perception is hopeful, intuitions are not hopeful.

What exactly differentiates hopefulness and hopelessness? The ability for self-correction and error-correction over time. Perception, such as visual perception can be corrected, and we know whenever its wrong. There's a large literature in cognitive psychology about just when and how people perceive optical illusions and under which conditions perception is more likely to yield falsehoods (such as under dark conditions). 

Intuitions, whenever they are used, are abandoned, such as in the philosophy of space-time where analysis of scientific theories have replaced the historically non-working practices of intuitive thought experiments (such as how Zeno's Paradox, Ross-Littlewood paradox etc. are no longer discussed as much in the philosophy of space-time) and failed arguments (such as Kant's a priori reasoning for Euclidean space). 

The author draws a parallel to introspectionism in psychology, and how disagreements where not intersubjectively corrigible. He brings up humorous instances of introspectionists in heated debate over whether the color green is a separate phenomenology from yellow and blue, or if it is equally yellow as it is blue. It's used as a scary example's for psychology students as to how to not do psychological science. 

The idea of the parallel is that disagreements between rival researchers, whenever the sources and evidences are hopeless, will never converge. At the very least we want to demand a third party that can solve any such dispute, and according to the author it's the best if we ourselves are such a third party. This can only be the case for systems that are hopeful, such as perception. 

He in the end does argue that some intuitions are hopeful, when they are corrigible and checkable for errors, such as mathematical intuition. Mathematicians can have an intuition over what theorem may be right or not, perhaps using visual imagination. Such an intuition can be shown to be correct or false by proving the theorem (or in case the intuition is wrong, its negation).
