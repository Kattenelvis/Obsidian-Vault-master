\section{}
As semantics solve the sea battle given that they've formalised the problem in a formal system and have provided an answer. However, which one best solves it depends on the metaphysics of determinism and indeterminism. 

If determinism is true, then Occamist semantics solves it the best. 

If indeterminism is true, then Lukasiewich solves it the best, since in a truly non-deterministic scenario, there is no truth value to future contingents.
