"Wilfrid Sellars [1962: 1] described philosophy as an attempt to ‘understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term’. But it is distinctive of philosophy that many of us are interested not only in how the world is but in ways that it could be. That is, philosophy is concerned with facts about modality. Some of the most important arguments in philosophy hinge on modal premises, and philosophers have typically assumed special expertise in evaluating these modal premises. Replicating Goldvarg and Johnson-Laird’s [ 2000] study of modal illusions, we show that training in mathematics and not philosophy predicts success in overcoming such illusions (n= 395). This study is the first to test the modal expertise of professional philosophers directly. Our findings undermine claims to modal expertise. Philosophical training does not inoculate expert philosophers against basic mistakes in modal judgment."

"Ourargument does not dependon anyparticular analysis of expertise. However, we assume that philosophers would have to outperform the general population and other academics to lay claim to the status of an expert. This is for the same reason as universities employ statistical consultants, even though the statistical skills of most experimentalists exceed those of the folk; a little learning can be a dangerous thing. When getting it right matters, as it does in philosophy (at least to us philosophers), we should consult only those with the greatest skills."

"One of the things that makes these judgments controversial is that there is generally no theory-independent way of verifying whether these judg ments are correct.1"


"Tobeclear, when a philosopher makes a logical mistake, it does not necessarily pre clude them from getting right an associated metaphysical judgment. For instance, a philosopher might think that P is logically impossible, even when, in fact, it is logically possible; they will infer that P is metaphysically impossible, too, but they might well be right about that. Or they could think that P is logically possible when, in fact, it is impossible and thus metaphysically impossible, too. But the philosopher may come to believe that P is metaphysically impossible for some other reason and therefore get the judgment right. These cases, however, are not cases of expert judgment as philosophers have gotten the judgment correct just by luck."

"s philosophers have gotten the judgment correct just by luck. By contrast, making faulty logical judgments can clearly lead philosophers to meta physical mistakes that undermine their claims to expertise. If a philosopher judges P to be metaphysically possible when it is provably logically impossible, they have made a mistake. Similarly, if philosophers judge P to be logically impossible and therefore metaphysically impossible, when P is provably logically possible and uncontroversially metaphysically possible, then philosophers will be demonstrably mistaken."

"It is difficult, for methodological purposes, to cleave a distinction between our logical and metaphysical skills, a fact readily observable in first-order philosophical debates. For instance, a standard way of arguing against the metaphysical possibility of philosophical zombies is to insist that, contrary to appearances, zombie cases are logically impossible. Several philosophers [Nagel 1998; Stoljar 2001; Kirk 2019] have made the point that what strikes some of us as ‘obviously possible could still turn out to harbour hidden contradictions’ [Kirk 2019: sec. 4]. Daniel Dennett [1995: 322] makes a similar point, arguing that those philosophers who take themselves to be conceiving of zombies ‘invariably underestimate the task of conception (or imagin ation), and end up imagining something that violates their own definition’."
