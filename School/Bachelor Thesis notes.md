Notes


Main issue: A lot of stuff a lot is noit sufficiently well explained

General structure is ok


Lucas-Penrose
Target audience: Other bachelors arguments
Not experts
Spell out more or not. 
Repeating myself

F not A is substituted by not provable predicate

Implies any AI is a Turing machine
reject that argument.



Chinese room

Not fleshing out the argument
Detail on the argument is exactly what is he arguing against. 
Arbitrary to throw out terms
Couple paragraphs fleshing it out
Jargon that's hard for the uninitiated to know what it means
for instance: GOFAI, Sub-symbolic processing
The main point still stands. 
Minor changes, twin earth response with minor changes (they are not perfect twins one has h2o one has xyz)



What is the frame problem
Boston Dynamics explain what that is
Write more on the book



Mathematical AI
AIXI too much jargon



Amplification premise amplivative argument
AI_0 = AI

Let k be a number between 1 to infinity
AI+ and then AI++

Should've been more clear that AI+ is at the top of humans, AI++ vastly greater than humans


Grammar a bit confusing "an infinite subpremises"
But maybe not explained well
Sorites but uncontroversial at other places
It's not the fact that it's an infinite number of premises that's the issue, it's that it takes a intelligent a stop.
Remove subpremises




Drew McDermott
extendibility premise P=NP also not explained
Explain that out well aswell


Always keep in mind what I'm trying to do with the paper
Loosing track of where the argument is actually going
Hold the readers hand, why are we talking about this.


Start a new section, take time to explain how the argument is relevant, why am I talking about it.
Not exctly clear cut when its needed
Keep readers attention why is this important why is this relevant.
