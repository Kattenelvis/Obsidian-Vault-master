Machery's restrictionistiska slutsatser gällande experimentell filosofi innebär att vi bör restriktera filosofisk metodologi sådant att det utesluter method of cases. Enligt Machery finns det två argument för restriktionism:

UNRELIABILITY: Emotions, framing effects, ordering effects, demography

DILEMMA: Filosofer måste acceptera ett av två delargument: DOGMATISM och PAROCHIALISM, som implicerar att method of cases är en felaktig metodologi. 

Dogmatism: Genuina skillnader i intuitioner av epistemiska liknande människor
Parhochialism: Samma intuitioner, men pratar om lite olika koncept. 

I båda fall kan man ta bort method of cases. 

Glacking kritiserar denna synpunkt på två sätt. 

Det första är hur folk svarar på enkäter. Det är nämnligen så att inom politisk vetenskap så har det funnit flera resultat som kan visa att folk som svarar på enkäter svarar utefter identitet och politisk signalering snarare än en genuin trosuppfattning eller intuition.

Underterminering av datan om filosofer svara annorlunda från lekmän pga att filosofi är transformatit eller om det är pga själv-bild, identitets bestämmning och signalering. 

Det andra är ett metodologiskt problem är hurvida transofmativa upplevelser som kan radikalt förändra folks trosuppfattningar och värderingar på stora sätt kan misslyckas att bli upptäckta av den statistiska genomsnitten. Även sådant som en filsofisk utbildning kan räknas som en transformativ upplevelse.

Man har inte tillgång till andra möjliga världar, utan det krävs en kontrollgrupp. Det är oklart om lekmän är en legitim kontrollgrup gäntemot filosofer, men detta är ett metodologiskt problem som verkar kunna lösas.  

Glacking utvecklar sin egna expertise defence mot dogmatism. Eftersom filosofer genomgår en transformativ upplevelse, som involverar att man har tillgång till olika slags bevis, så är dom inte epistemic peers. Därför fallerar argumentet.




Endast en tredjedel är causal-historiska gällande referens. Men tydligen ska det vara konsensus gällande gödel-schmitt intuitioner? 







"On the basis of UNRELIABILITY and DILEMMA, then, Machery advances what he calls “radical restrictionism”, a philosophical methodology of thoroughgo ing modal scepticism. That is, “we ought to suspend judgement in response to not only most current philosophical cases, but also the type of actual and possible case that would be most useful for philosophizing about modally immodest philosophical issues” (Machery 2017, p. 7). Questions about “what knowledge, moral responsibil ity, and causation essentially are… require some epistemic access we don’t have” for their answers (Machery 2017, p. 8). So what is left for philosophy is a “rebooted” conceptual analysis consisting of the descriptive analysis of concepts as they are used, on the basis of experimental data and other observations of behaviour (Mach ery 2017, p. 212-3), and a prescriptive analysis that reforms those concepts in either “Carnapian” (explicatory, clarifying, precisifying; see Carnap 1950, ch. 1; Carnap 1963) or “Gramscian” (ameliorative, liberatory, critical; see Gramsci 2000, p. 216; Haslanger 2006) fashion. A “method of cases 2.0”, then (Machery 2017, p. 239 − 40), will allow the use of thought-experiments just as long as they eschew “modally immodest” speculations, and examine the “everyday” judgements not merely of the author and her philosophical interlocutors, but of samples of participants, subjected to statistical analysis."



Trumpists are more likely (15%) to pick the right phorograph with fewer people at the inaguration than the Obama one. 

In political science, people respond not based on intuition but based on identity, what they support and political leaning. 

"Xiang (2014) shows that both Tibetan monks and lay Tibetans are much more likely than Westerners to approve of pushing the large person to save f ive people in “footbridge” cases. But most strikingly, “(t)he judgements of Tibetan monks are… remarkably in line with their explicit moral teachings (in particular, with the skill in means sutra)”""It is hardly motivated reason ing to say that this looks like a group “toeing the party line” by demonstrating adher ence to a religious doctrine, and a sub-group with a particularly strong commitment toeing it particularly diligently.6"



"Likewise, the entertaining finding that U.S. liberals are much more comfortable with pushing someone with a stereotypically “white” name – Chip Ellsworth III – to save 100 members of the Harlem Jam Orchestra, rather than pushing someone with an African American-coded name – Tyrone Pay ton – in order to save 100 members of the New York Philharmonic (Uhlmann et al. 2009; Machery 2017, p. 81),"
"has an obvious communicative explanation; what is sometimes pejoratively termed “virtue-signalling”, or the demonstration (to oneself as much as to others) of one’s commitment to things like reparative justice, esteem for minority culture, or the prioritisation of disadvantaged racial interests"

"But really any survey data produced by the empirical studies, or any pattern of variation in them, can be interpreted as illocutionary; those providing “utilitarian” responses in trolley case studies might genuinely hold utilitarian views, or they might be signal ling their detached unsentimental rationality, sanguine moral seriousness in making “hard choices”, bravado, or even Star Trek-fandom.7"

"7 “Logic dictates that the needs of the many must outweigh the needs of the few”; Mr. Spock, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)"


"Of course, one could object that while it is plausible for survey responses about morality, gender, race, or politics – issues over which the general public is emotion ally polarised – to be primarily expressive of respondents’ self-conception, such an explanation is much less likely for responses to questions about theories of seman tic reference, analyses of knowledge, and so on, which non-philosophers are rarely much troubled by."
But professional philosophers might!

"One obvious possible explanation of some ordering effects, for instance, is that respondents are more concerned with viewing themselves as and their responses as internally consistent than they are with the particular claims they consequently make. This in turn suggests a second line of defense; insofar as we have reason to think that philosophers respond expressively to questions about the topics they have devoted their lives to studying, and insofar as we can see the same sensitivity to supposedly irrelevant contextual factors in the responses of professional philosophers and lay people, as Machery claims,8 we have grounds to extrapolate that the laypeople may be responding expressively too."



Finanial incentives makes people answer more truthfully!



"A social science experiment, they note, “asks the world a question” (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 320), typically about its causal structure; whether one’s gender, for instance, affects one’s propensity to express Gettier-intuitions about knowledge. It does this “by comparing populations that differ systematically only on some treat ment of theoretical interest” (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 321); here, being born and raised as male or female. Ideally, this would involve studying the same population in different possible worlds, differing only in that the study population in the treatment world received the treatment in question, and the identical study population in the control world did not. In this way, we could directly observe counterfactual depen dence, and confidently infer causation. Of course, however, trans-modal experimen tation of this sort would be metaphysically impossible; and it would not in any case tell us anything about the causal mechanism responsible for the effect."


"“(w)hy not just ask the research subjects how the effect of interest was caused, for example with respect to their preferences or their impres sion of the factors perceived as relevant to their decisions?” (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 322). First, this will not work because as we see in the case of expressive responding, testimony is unreliable; “some mechanisms may not be socially desirable to report, … subject to rationalization or confirmation bias, … or … psychologically opaque to the research subject for other reasons” (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 322)."

"The aim is to get the world to answer the scientist’s question in the form of experimental data, not 1 3 S. N. Glackin the scientist’s own theoretical interpretation, or the interpretations of her subjects.10 Secondly, it will not work because, as discussed below, such studies cannot directly examine effects on individuals, and must use groups of individuals as proxies (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 324)."


Experimental vs Observational. Can't do an experimental set up where you kill half their parents or make them live as homeless people for a year.

"All observational and experimental studies therefore face what is known as the “fundamental identification problem”"

"All observational and experimental studies therefore face what is known as the “fundamental identification problem” (Holland 1986; Rubin 1974, 2005). This arises because counterfactual worlds are epistemically inaccessible; we cannot simultane ously observe the same subject both with and without the treatment being investi gated. So whether by controlled randomized experiments, or by carefully designed observational studies that aim to approximate them, social scientists “replace the estimation of individual treatment effects with average treatment effects” (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 324); by averaging over the effects on populations that are as close as possible to equivalent with respect to the variables of interest, they can overcome the problem of heterogeneity between the actual individuals assigned the treatment, and those putative counterparts assigned to the control group."



"The new problem Paul and Healy raise concerns “transformative treatments”, or treatments which “radically change treated individuals in a way that creates a mis match in populations, but this mismatch is not empirically detectable at the level of counterfactual dependence” (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 320); Such events may include, but are not limited to, having a child; participating in military combat; suffering massive physical trauma; undergoing intense train ing in medical or law school; or having a sudden religious conversion. People who have gone through these experiences often report that their beliefs and preferences are radically different now in ways that make their previous lives seem alien to them, or that they now have core beliefs or values that their previ ous selves would have rejected. (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 329)"

"Such “transformative experiences” seem to replace the prior core beliefs and values of those who undergo them; but a counterfactual test cannot tell whether they are indeed replaced, or are simply revealed."

"First, the underdetermination noted by Paul and Healy means it is impossible to do more than speculate at what causes such an effect; the data will look the same whether training in philosophy has really had a transformative effect on the subjects’ intuitive responses to philosophical issues, or whether subjects are simply expressively responding, regardless of their actual intuitions, in the way that for one reason or another they feel, given their training and their consequent self-image as philosophers, that they ought to."




"The argument rests, recall, on extrapolation from the general vulnerability of questionnaire responses to demo graphic and framing effects to the unreliability of philosophers’ intuitions about the cases they present"



"But if the transformative effect of training people in philosophy – of making them “experts” – means that that the non-expert populations studied by experimental philosophers no longer constitute a valid control group, no such extrap olation can be made. There is no question, then, of replication, whether successful or failed; no single population of peers to “partition”."


"“x is an epistemic peer of y with respect to a particular claim if and only if x has the same amount of evidence y has, has considered it as carefully as y has, is as intelligent as y, and is immune to the reasoning biases y is immune to”"

"So much for restrictionism; what are the lessons here for “positive” X-Phi? Firstly, there’s a point of caution; if it’s not clear that groups of lay people form a control group for studies of philosophers’ judgements, then it’s not clear that any useful con clusion can be drawn from such studies. This is not necessarily cause for despair; Paul and Healy present it as “a methodological challenge” to be overcome by resourceful and innovative researchers (Paul and Healy 2018, p. 334). But it does cast doubt on the significance of much existing data."
