# 36 Teodicitet, problem of evil


You can reject some premise, or trying to reconcile them in 3 different ways:
1. Soul building theory: The goodness is greater thanks to suffering
2. Sins, we deserve it. Evil doesn't really exist, it is the absence of good.
3. Leibniz best of all possible worlds



Mackie argument lidandet's problem
I agree with Mackie I think, well, depends on the Euthyphro dilemma that one can derive negative utilitarianism.

Could be a final value in freedom as more valued than pleasure, even stricly better so than

$(F, S)$ total numerical score in some possible world from fredoom F and goodness S

$(0,1) > (0,2) >\dots > (1,0) > (1,1) \dots$



Branching time temporal logic. God knows all possible timelines and all possible choices for all possible timesteps on every timeline. Could've prevented the realization of actions that lead to worse timelines. Marching towards maximum good.

Skapa icke-människor då!

Notes från Mackie's artikel:
- Good cannot be without evil
- So God is not omnipotent?
- God cannot create what is logically impossible
- But some reply God can choose the rules of reasoning, as in divine command theory for ethical commands. 
- Good as a relational property like "big" and "small". God being better than rather than the good. 
- Good and Evil are also not logical opposites
- Bullshit about the color red: Red only if non-redness, if we saw everything red there'd somehow be no name for it. Hard disagree but not the main focus of the article.
- Evil as a instrumental goal for the goal of evil, has to be a causal (mental?) law that restricts Omnipotence. But causal laws are made by God according to theists. 
- First order Good, Second order Good, First order Evil.
- Some FOE is needed to increase SOG (by logical necessity) 
- God only ever maximises SOG
- But there could be second order evil! And probably is! Which God could've prevented
- Infinite regress of third levels etc.
- Free will as a third level good, logically necessarily with Second order evil
- No! God could limit free will to only choose good things. We already have limitations anyways.
- Omnipotence in a similar way of second order choices etc. such that God is no longer omnipotent.

Den som står brevid skulle vara "psykopat" i.e Gud.

Helevetet problemet med evil ännu värre

Ens modus ponens är en annans modus tollens
$p\rightarrow q$

$p$
$q$

$\neg q$
$\neg p$

In such a scenario, we may need probabilistic judgment between p and ~q
