The ontological argument posits that there's an ultimate, self-caused cause or self-explanatory explanation $H$ of the existence of everything else. It is then shown that $H$ has properties typically associated with God as it is unrestricted by causality, must operate on free-will, and has the space of possible worlds to actualize (video 20??). The argument is of the following character:

1. There exists a finite past
2. Everything has a cause (Principle of sufficient reason, PSR)
3. The universe has a cause
4. An explanation for the universe must have properties associated with God such as necessary being etc.
5. $God exists
(KÃ¤lla video 20)


At this point it's important to separate between explanation and cause, as these two concepts are quite different in the philosophy of science and should not be confused. It's either that every event has a cause, or every proposition has an explanation. If for instance something comes into being i.e $\exists x. P(x)$ is true at timepoint $t$, this can be explained by for instance covering-law explanations which includes the relevant causal laws and initial conditions and $t-1$. Explanations covers much more than what causal facts do, including the existence of the universe in ways in which initial conditions and natural laws are not relevant when we're talking about nomonological causation.



# Steady-state and cyclic Cosmology

The arguments in favor of universe with beginning generally apply the Big Bang model of cosmology. For instance the FRW-solution to Einstein's field equations of an isotropic and homogeneous universe which yield a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ that purport to show the expansion rate of the universe is positive, which is supported by experimental evidence from the red-shifting of galaxies. Certain arguments such as the singularity theorems with some added assumptions extrapolate the expansion backwards, there'd be a singularity point where all spacetime curves meet as $t\rightarrow 0$, of which our current physics begins to break down. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology/. 

Models of cyclic cosmology do exist and are both internally consistent and consistent with experimental CMD results. Craig argues that they are somehow inferior source: [The New Atheism and Five Arguments for God | Popular Writings | Reasonable Faith](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-new-atheism-and-five-arguments-for-god) . 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borde%E2%80%93Guth%E2%80%93Vilenkin_theorem


One steady state model still defended is Quasi-stead-state-cosmology (QSSC) which states that the universe has existed and has been expanding for an infinite amount of time, and where energy-matter is continually created to prevent radical entropy increase. Entropy has been used to defend theism by stating that a infinitely existing universe would have reached maximum entropy, but this need not be the case at all. 

[Cosmology and Theology (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology-theology/)

Another is Quantum-Loop-Cosmology (QLC) based on quantum loop gravity (QLG). QLG quantizes the gravitational field and associated properties of momentum, position, scalar curvature, mass-energy tensor, into operators on a Hilbert space, forcing the values to be finite, bounded and subject to the uncertainty principle. It turns out that the dynamical equations of LQC extend backwards to before the big bang!

But it gets worse for the cosmological theologian. The most popular unifying theory, string theory, when applied to cosmology, posit that the universe has existed before. Strings, by being spatially extended simples, make singularities impossible. 

Penrose's model of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology he posits that right before a big bang, large-scale matter structures can be approximated away, leading way to a set of conformal symmetries of different Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. One can smoothly bring an ever-expanding universe into a new universe. 

New cyclic cosmology instead describes a big-crunch to big-bang model utilizing string theory.

"Existence Is Evidence of Immortality by Michael Huemer Abstract: Time may be infinite in both directions. If it is, then, if persons could live at most once in all of time, the probability that you would be alive now would be zero. Since you are alive now, with certainty, either the past is finite, or persons can live more than once."


Another argument is Hilbert's Hotel by Craig. He posits that actual infinities lead to 'paradoxes' such as an infinite library having infinite books, where half are red and half are black, where the set of black books is equally large as the set of all black and red books combined! But this is a misnomer. The cardinality of sets may not be the exact same as the intuitive understanding of "larger". The precise one-to-one mapping between sets which cardinality is defined by may not always match our intuitions. Thus we can say the combined red+black books are larger than just the red one's, even if they have equal cardinality and a one-to-one mapping can be established. [Clack, Beverley_ Clack, Brian R. - Philosophy of Religion _ a Critical Introduction.-Wiley (2014).pdf](file:///C:/Users/Katte/Documents/Academic/Philosophy/Religion/Clack,%20Beverley_%20Clack,%20Brian%20R.%20-%20Philosophy%20of%20Religion%20_%20a%20Critical%20Introduction.-Wiley%20(2014).pdf)

Hilbert Hotel is also not a paradox, and does not yield any contradictions, it would be simply unintuitive for most humans.    


# The (multi)universe as the necessary being

A theist may defend their view by stating that a universe with an infinite past must have some ontological basis or explanation, rather than a cause, which explains the continual existence of the universe. Such a view may also be more accommodating to libertarian free will as strict nomonological causality is not needed to justify the existence of God.

If one posits some kind of contingency argument, such an explanation may involve a necessary existent being, which would have divine perfections. (video typ 18). 

1. The world is contingent
2. Nothing contingent can explain all contingent things
3. A necessary thing must explain the world

Most argue that the actual world is not a necessary thing. Craig, in his disjunctive elimination syllogism for the fine-tuning argument for the existence of God, argues by appeal to intuition that the actual world isn't necessarily existent. I will defend the notion that the universe, or multiverse, can be necessarily existent.[The world as a neccessary being.pdf](file:///C:/Users/Katte/Documents/Academic/Philosophy/The%20world%20as%20a%20neccessary%20being.pdf) 

If the theist argues that the necessary being has their existence explained by virtue of their necessary existence, which makes intuitive sense, then we should also take it that the world (or the multiverse) itself may be necessarily existent.

Assuming Modal Realism, i.e that every possible world exists, is true, we can derive the necessary existence of the multiverse. While [cosmological argument section like 5] argues that this is God, [citation] has argued that the multiverse is simply the necessarily existent thing. 

One may wonder why we should accept such a controversial proposition such as modal realism. The fact is that a final theory $T$ may imply modal collapse i.e everything possible is necessary, and as such the universe has no need for an agential necessary being to explain its existence. This is reminiscent of Spinoza's pantheism, as he also argues for modal collapse and that the universe is the necessary being. 


# Conclusion

In conclusion I will have argued that the cosmological argument, including a weaker version of it, fails to hold up to scrutiny. Thus we cannot use the cosmological argument as an argument for the existence of God. We may instead show that the (multi)universe itself is the necessary being, calling for a kind of Pantheism as most.

Anaphora:
"Everything has a cause"
Does that mean there is a unique cause for every event, or a unique event for every cause? Just like the "every farmer beats a horse".

With the PSR we could state that all possible worlds exist, and that there are hidden contradictions in all worlds which we may think are possible are actually impossible, thus only this world could even exist. Not a brute fact but self-explanatory

# Fine Tuning (might delete)


The fine tuning problem ends up being defeated by a strong anthropic principle, such as that implied by the multiverse hypothesis. The problem is also multiplied by how unlikely the universe is, given that it is supposidely fine tuned for human life. Hiddeness, disagreement, multiple holy books, the size of the universe, the evolutionary process etc. 

But the ontological argument may still uphold, for what created the multiverse?


As Dawkins says, the anthropic principle is a response to the theist. Richard Dawkings does not know the difference between the strong and the weak anthropic principle. However, Dawkins fail to take into consideration the weak and the strong anthropic principles as different.  (The God Delusion chapter 3 and 4)
