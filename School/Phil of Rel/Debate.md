The main debate is between science vs religion, but rather belief systems of naturalism vs theism.

His main reason God exists: Science can be done? Rationally accessible? Scientists believe the universe is rationally intelligible. How is that justified? Plantinga's naturalism argument smh... We cannot trust the reductionism of the mind to particles as being rational nor having any justification. Tracable to the rationality of God. 

Historical scientists driven by the belief in God, as the law-likeness of the universe "requires" a law-giver. 
Sturmark agrees, but says nothing about Gods existence, but what belief in god causes. 

Fine-Tuning argument

Cannot attribute DNA to an....unguided process? What?

Consciousness is a Information processor we are aware that is personal, therefore God? Intelligent and personal origin? Not god in the gaps, but increased science that gives evidence for God. 


The multiverses are inaccessible. Fine tuning within our universe? 



Evidence for God: Life cannot start on earth by natural processes alone (or atleast, astronomically low probability).

Sturmak reply: God of the Gaps. There are artificial cells. A few years until it happends. 

Lennox Reply: Configurations of signs/semiotics that have extremely low probability of occurring with just natural processes, infers intelligence as the explanation. "Language of the cell" Cuh. Humans creating cells prooves intelligence creates cell. 

Sturmark reply: Watch argument: Finding a watch in the forest etc. but for the Eye, the bacteria etc. but biologists have so far always found a sufficient explanation.

Ulf Reply: Payley watch argument. Darwins theory of evolution gives an explanation for why the world looks ordered

Lennox Reply: Book: Evolution without natural selection. "That is the theory" I argue no, the theory is just about natural selection as a statistical hypothesis. It explains the ordering, that's not the theory itself. 

Historical faultas in biology


God explains scientific explanations

Hinduism prooven by a team of computer scientists

God gives a grounding for the mind for rationality, naturalism undermines this, so we cannot trust it. 
Ulf: We have reasons to doubt our minds! Cognitive science, bias, evolutionary processes being unreliable, not truth-tracking but rather survival-and-reproduction-maximising. 





## Christer Sturmark
Naturalist viewpoint

Principle: Following the evidence
Will include God if adding God adds to the explanation for anything in reality/reality itself
John Lennox Agrees

Inaccessible to science if God is outside sp0ace-time, therefore inaccessible. That kind of God cannot be analyzed by science. Irrelevant God. Meaningless concept. Doesn't expand explanatory power. Doesn't tell about morals. Cannot interfere with the world, and if it could it can no longer be seperate space-time. 
John Lennox Agrees

But the God buried by science superbeing with miracles walking on water turning water into wine born virgin rise from dead. That concept of God has been buried by science. 
John Lennox: Where is said evidence?


Burden of proof is on God side


Science cannot prove the non-existence of anything

## Stefan Gustavson (The Priest)

The feels, I feel about the universe has God and I feel the meaning of life guuh I had bad vibes about this guy.

Science towards god ig.


Naturalism is not the same as science



## Ulf Danielsson (Physicsts)

Art and music answers........meaning and morality!?? Guh

Multiverse to answer the fine-tuning objection.
It's within the theory of String theory and cosmological inflation
A parallel is multi-planet theory, but Lennox replies that we might be alone citing a book.

Did God fine-tune earth?
Lennox: Don't know! No information


Why is the universe intelligible: Multiverse theory. Processes such as cognition requires an intelligible universe to form at all. Anthropic explanation.

Biological beings, embodied and embedded cognition. Not just observers, we are studying ourselves.

Is the universe actually intelligible? Physics only pick simple problems. Hard problem of consciousness and social psychology is much more complicated. Math is limited??? Uhh Chaos theory??? Harmonic oscillators are solved precicely. 

Lennox: Unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. Unreasonable by naturalism, not theism? 
Fine-Tuning within this universe too?
Fine-Tuning going away does not imply God doesn't exist. What created the multi-verse? And we get the cosmological argument still.

Which is the most parsimonious to believe in? One universe + One God or very many universes? One fewer objects, one fewer predicates.
