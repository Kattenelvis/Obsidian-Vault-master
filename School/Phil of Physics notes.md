"Such thought experiments usually probe some foundational assumption, concerning space, time, locality, causality, determinism, matter, force, and so on. This kind of approach amounts to philosophical thinking (in the sense of conceptual analysis)."

"One can’t really do physics without making certain assumptions, however minimal, about how the theories one is using map onto reality (even if it is only mapping onto observable reality, as some believe [anti-realists, such as instrumentalists or constructive empiricists, who give unobservables the ‘silent treatment’], though even this is not so benign a claim as they think).[1]"

"One important factor is that the pre-Socratics, and those working before the Medieval period, relied on naked eye observations. There were no amplifications of vision as there have been since Galileo modified the looking glass (until then a simple gypsy toy) into a telescope for scientific usage. There was, in fact, no real experimental method. Some kinds of experiments could no doubt be said to have occurred, but this was not viewed as the royal road to worldly knowledge as it is today. This meant that theoretical structures were far more heavily based on what was delivered through the senses. However, as we will see in a moment, this wasn’t always the case, and unobservables invoked to explain observables can be found in theories in the earliest fragments of writing."

"For example, spacetime theories are presented through ‘models’ of the form <ℳ,$l^i$>  , consisting of some basic set of point-elements ℳ (a set of points with a certain size or cardinality) on which is imposed various levels of additional structure $l^i$ that let one talk about, e.g. the dimension of the space, the nearness of points, the distance of points, volumes, parallelism, and so on. This then provides the basic object whose mapping onto the world (or a world) we must, wearing our philosophy of physics hats, consider – that is, we must provide an interpretation."

"However, we can find strikingly similar dichotomies [in ancient physics] to those found in modern theories: discrete versus continuous space; infinite versus finite space; real time versus illusory time; eternal time versus beginning of time; plenum versus void; many worlds versus one world; and so on"

"There are also discussions of motion and its relationship with space and time, along with the ramifications a denial of the former has on the latter, and vice versa. Let us mention some of these views, since they provide a nice route into some of the more modern debates we discuss later."

Aristotle: Earth in center, copernican revolution destroys it with fact and logic

"In the Aristotelian universe there are five elements (Aether, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth) that have ‘natural places’ that determine their behaviors (natural motions) relative to the Earth’s frame. This is a teleological world in which things are guided by where they should be: fire wants to rise; earth wants to fall. This is a law of sorts, and it is based to some extent on observations. But it certainly doesn’t have same level of rigor of modern physical laws, nor does it strike one as particularly explanatory, nor does it seem capable of generating very interesting predictions."

"The notion of a natural motion (in which a body finds its ‘proper place’) and a ‘forced (or “violent”) motion’ (in which a body is taken off its proper course by some intervention) is the origin of the modern concepts of kinematics and dynamics respectively, which we will meet again."

"We needn’t trouble ourselves with questions of truth and realism; though connected, that’s strictly a separate matter. We can think about ‘model worlds’ (possible worlds) that ground the belief instead. Our own, actual world might be among this class of possible worlds, but it is not necessary in order to provide an interpretation (and an associated ontological picture)."


## 1.3

Comparing interpreting rorchard ink blots with interpreting physical theories. "What we are faced with in physics is not inkblots but mathematical structures of some kind. Just as with the Rorschach test different subjects will interpret the self-same blot in many and varied ways, so one and the same mathematical formalism can (very often) be understood in many different ways."

"But this isn’t a free for all: the ways one can interpret the formalism are highly constrained by the world (experience and experimental evidence) and by logical and mathematical consistency. However, even these tight constraints leave much elbow room, resulting in world-pictures entirely at odds with one another in all but empirical matters."

Interpreting Beethoven song S, "close enough" isomorphism with S* that one interprets. Multiplicity of interpretation. Tim Bayne and the push through construction? Maybe...

"“The question of interpretation [asks:] what would it be like for this theory to be true, and how could the world possibly be the way this theory says it is?”"
"The interpreter will then answer by specifying the class of possible worlds that make the theory true in the sense of satisfying the basic theoretical postulates (laws or axioms)"


Ulam:"Even the most idealistic point of view of mathematics as a pure creation of the human mind must be reconciled with the fact that the choice of definitions and axioms of geometry – in fact of most mathematical concepts – is the result of impressions obtained through our senses from external stimuli and inherently from observations and experiments in the ‘external world.’ ([51], p. 284)"

# 2 Symmetries

Special relativity has 2 meta laws:

1. Laws are covariant between inertial reference frames
2. The speed of light is constant

Thermodynamics has 1:

1. No laws can imply that there exists a perpetual motion machine



"These high-level laws are then defined by invariance with respect to some class of transformations (some way of shifting, rotating, evolving, twisting, or otherwise morphing the system), in which case we say that the laws in question are covariant with respect to those transformations – with the systems themselves then said to be invariant rather than covariant (the relevant quantities of the systems, such as energy or momentum, are then said to be conserved). In the case of special relativity above, the task was to find a set of transformation laws that preserve the principles (given that those principles seem to have a solid status in reality, as revealed by experiment)."
Lorentz Transformations

G Galilean relativity → The covariance of the equations of motion (laws) under Galilean transformations. 

SR Special relativity → The covariance of the equations of motion (laws) under Lorentz transformations.


# 3 Symmetries


"Such scenarios underlie many philosophical debates since there are both arguments for viewing the transformed states as physically distinct (despite their indistinguishability) and for viewing the transformed states as physically one and the same possibility (that is simply being represented in different ways)."

Galilean transformations form a group!!
"three parameters to describe spatial translations, a single parameter for temporal translation, reorientations about the three axes of space (three more parameters), and velocity ‘boosts’ in each of the three directions of space (another three parameters)."

Formally, we have a state $(x,t)$ such that we can apply a transformation such that it becomes $(Ax + vt+b, t+s)$ 

So for any solution x(t) on the position of some particle at time $t$, we can shift them with the transformations given above (for instance, $A\in SO(3)$ ) and still get the same solution. 

Same in intrinsic properties, but not extrinsic properties (except for the trivial transformation I'd presume). 

Equivalence class of models that explain similar systems (but in different positions, time's, rotations). This can limit the number of possible worlds. (Seems connected to humean vs non-humean laws worlds who are the exact same but with different laws cannot exist according to Humeans). As Leibniz say, is the world different if left and right swapped places?

THESE SYMMETRIES ARE CONNECTED WITH CONSERVED QUALITIES!!

Translation symmetry leads to conservation of momentum;

Time translation symmetry to conservation of energy; 

Rotation symmetry to conservation of angular momentum.

WOW

"If there weren’t these stable features under the various operations, then one could use the alterations to detect location, time, velocity, and orientation."

"That we cannot do this also points to features of the spatiotemporal system itself: it must be isotropic (with no preferred direction) and homogeneous (look the same everywhere and everywhen)."

"Naturally, the kinds of objects that are left most unperturbed under various operations (those that are most insensitive to a barrage of transformations that attempt to change them) are going to be homogeneous among themselves we find this even with quantum particles, which are identical in terms of their intrinsic properties, so that switching them leaves the laws of quantum mechanics none the wiser."


Bas Van Fraasen: Theories contain ontology and laws
Only be committed to the equivalence class of possible worlds.

Geometric vs Dynamic symmetries

Geometric symmetries 
The symmetries of space, and that space is uniform (isotropic and homogeneous) and that events on space can be changed and still be uniform.

Dynamic Symmetries
include say a phase shift in the wave equation of particles. They still retain most of their properties despite that. 

Continuous vs discrete symmetries
Lie groups are continius symmetries

Global vs Local
"General relativity has such a local spacetime symmetry based on Diff(ℳ), the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold (spacetime, that is) these diffeomorphisms essentially just turn one manifold into another by moving the points of the spacetime manifold around. What this means, very roughly, is that the laws of general relativity (Einstein’s field equations for the gravitational field) are invariant with respect to any smooth transformation of the points of spacetime that keeps the structure of the spacetime manifold intact (which means, again very roughly, that the transformation does not end up ‘tearing’ the spacetime manifold or putting holes in it"


"To connect up to the discussion about laws, symmetries, and possible worlds: if we have some solution of the Einstein equations (which represents a possible world), then if we transform it by applying one of these diffeomorphisms we have ourselves another possible world that satisfies the laws of general relativity. In this sense, the group of diffeomorphisms is the symmetry group of the theory."

Experimentally, in 1957, left and right ARE different:

"Counterintuitively, this symmetry (parity symmetry) is indeed violated, for certain lawlike processes (namely, those involving the so-called weak interaction). What we find is that electrons (or beta particles) in a beta decay process will preferentially be shot out of the South side (relative to a strong magnetic field) than the North side. The original experiment was carried out with Cobalt-60 atoms."

Twin Paradox. Both space farer and earth being will think the other one aged more than themselves. It seems like ourselves are stationary while the other one is traveling at near the speed of light, such that time dilation occurrs for the other one but not oneself. 

Resolution is by considering the acceleration and change in inertial reference frame from the space-farer. At the point of acceleration the relative "now" compared to earth will be immediately "skipped" assuming infinite acceleration (or really rapidly assuming finite acceleration).

But the problem is when you consider the possible topologies of space. Space could be shaped in such a way where going in one direction lends you back to where you started. A doughnut toplogy. Now how does it work, without any acceleration point if someone just travels in one direction?

"So here is an asymmetry: there are non-trivial (topological) differences in the quads’ trajectories. This causes differences in their frames and is already enough to dissolve the paradox."

Flaten out the square, tile the plane, calculate the length of worldlines (longer paths means less ageing).![[Pasted image 20240411225200.png]]



# 4.4 The hole argument


A lack of matter/energy in some region allows for an underdetermination in topology choice. A diffeomorphism can be made. This makes GR indeterministic, as a set of initial conditions (with a hole?) lead to different time-evolutions given different diffeomorphisms.

So that's quite the schock given Putnam's earlier argument for fatalism given SR. 




As we will see in §5.3, having multiple possible futures from some initial conditions amounts to indeterminism, and so it appears as though general relativity itself is indeterministic. For example, by running the initial state through the equations of general relativity (the laws), we might generate the world represented by the model ℳ, g, T or we might generate the world ℳ, *g, *T (where is a diffeomorphism, of which we have infinitely many to choose from, and * an operation that drags fields, such as g and T, around over the points of the manifold).


# 5.1


A finite disc world with a force that contracts objects as they approach the radius such that they don't notice it will measure an hyperbolic infinite world. But Fleincaré might posulate an theory that is underdetermined by that one: Forces that squish everything approaching the edge and is finite/euclidean. 


Spherical worlds are the same. You might return to where you started, or it was just so happened to be duplicated. 

"Reichenbach ([39], §17) has also extended this to other scientific facts at the basis of our theories, such as the uniformity of time (relating to the metric of time), which is based on the idea that we stipulate (by a ‘coordinative definition’) that, e.g. a pendulum’s swings cover equal periods of time– this is based on the fact that we can’t compare successive durations, there is simply no way to test such a thing:"

We may have to chose some convention based on simplicity, pragmatic utility etc. when it comes to the geometry of space and time. Do we have to accept anti-realism about geometry at all? Not so fast, we can claim that there is some true, non-inditerminate geometry and time. But that this is unkowable. 

"Another escape from anti-realism is to argue that, as with units, we know that there aren’t really two separate ‘theories of the world’ being offered: one and the same physical content is represented by both systems. This suggests treating a theory as a kind of equivalence class of its observationally identical presentations: theories are systems that tell us what we will observe and explain what we have observed."

T-duality in string theory, strings defined on radius R have a equivalent structure on one defined on 1/R. This is the same undetdetermination and  convention choice that plagues the structure of space. 



# 6.1 Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics


"In this house we OBEY THE LAWS **OF THERMODYNAMICS**"
- Homer Simpsons

"Thermodynamics, as the name suggests, is the study of the thermal properties of matter (‘the scientific study of heat’). Statistical mechanics is a study of complex systems – i.e. reasonably sized objects with many parts. But rather than studying such objects by decomposing them into their simpler parts, and studying those in order to learn about the complex system, the subject deals with more coarse grained (‘equilibrium’ or simply ‘thermodynamic’) variables. Common examples are temperature, mass, pressure, volume, and entropy. In a sense, these variables bundle together the properties of the constituent parts (whatever they may be) into a single number characterizing the whole system."


"Already in the very act of defining statistical mechanics and thermodynamics we have introduced two deep issues: 

1. How are the probabilities in this approach to be understood? 
2. What is the precise nature of the relationship between the micro and macro-levels?"


Frequentist approach towards probability using the law of averages/large numbers.

Number of heads after $N$ throws is the random variable $H_N$. 
We expect $H_N/N$ to approach 0.5 as N goes to infinity.

"The reasoning is quite intuitive: the frequencies here involve various possible arrangements of things (microstates) such that the number of these various arrangements (some of which will be effectively identical) become probabilities."

But if we can reverse the laws, the microlaws, why don't we see coffe and milk unmixing?

"As philosopher Huw Price puts it: symmetry in, symmetry out. Conversely, to get an asymmetry out demands an asymmetry in the input. This input asymmetry, as discovered by barrister-turned-physicist Samuel Burbury, is the assumption of molecular chaos: pre-collision particles (i.e. their velocities and positions) are uncorrelated (probabilistically independent: random), but not so post-collision. In other words, the collisions of the particles are responsible for the observed entropy increase such that for any given distribution of states of the particles, it will inevitably evolve into an equilibrium state (the maximally random Maxwell state)."


"The second law can be seen in the same example: whereas initially the energy could do work – e.g. imagine a pulley system in which one end of the rope is attached to the cup and the other to a small mass (sitting on the floor perhaps) weighing less than the cup, so that dropping the cup from the table would see the mass rise – afterwards, when there is only thermal (random) energy, one cannot do useful work anymore, despite no loss of total energy in the whole system."


"The definition involves a mathematical procedure known as ‘coarse graining,’ which, as the name suggests, neglects certain fine but observationally irrelevant details of macroscopic properties. Starting with a system’s phase space, one divides it into cells, such that all of the phase points within a cell (henceforth: ‘microstates’) correspond to one and the same macroscopic state (henceforth: ‘macrostate’). In other words, the cells are equivalence classes where the relation of equivalence is ‘has the same macrostate as,’ which just means that one would not be able to distinguish between those microstates by observing the macrostate. An assumption of equiprobability is then made, such that each microstate is just as likely as any other. Crucially, this does not mean that each macrostate is equally as likely to be realized as any other: those macrostates that are associated with more microstates clearly have an advantage."

Maxwells demon: Entropy reversal??!!

"Rolf Landauer famously argued that provided the demon recorded the measurements (with perfect precision) then the process he carried out would be perfectly reversible and therefore not entropy-increasing: if a record of some process exists, then the process is reversible; if not, then it is irreversible, and such irreversibility is the hallmark of entropy. The problem is, it would require a vast amount of memory resources to keep track of all those processes. In order to keep track, it would have to wipe its memory now and again. But this would make the process irreversible (leaving no record with which it could restore the earlier state), thus safeguarding the second law. Hence, Maxwell’s demon needs to be absent-minded for the example to perform its function. However, wiping a memory creates entropy since the states held in the ‘memory register’ are shrunk down to one (0, say)."

Interpretations of probabilities again.

So umm idea:

Either QM is complete or incomplete
EPR paradox implies it's incomplete
Bell's theorem, one premise must be false by experimental results. 
It cannot be hidden variables. Therefore some other premise is false.
Gives credence to the Copenhagen interpretation being false?

"In the latter case, the wavefunction becomes a plane wave spread over the whole of space (in theory, out to infinity). Moreover, we can see that trying to localize a particle restricts its motion, which in quantum theory involves more energy: probing smaller scales demands greater energies, which is why ever larger particle accelerators are required to go to ‘deeper’ levels of reality"

Idea on the uncertianty principe: As the wavefunction becomes a plane that spreads over for infinity, surely this is limited by the speed of light? And does this effect how one can measure momentum in such case?

"The problem is, if we use high momentum photons, as we must to find out the position with a high degree of accuracy, then we kick the electron with those photons, imparting an uncertainty in its momentum. But if we were to use photons with lower momenta, then one faces the problem that the position is not pinned down closely enough."

"Quite simply, to localize a particle requires bouncing something off it. Finer localization requires higher energies so that the bounce will be stronger. However, this bounce will cause the particle to be uncertain in its momentum values, essentially being nudged to new values from the imparted momentum."

"There have been some recent experimental attacks on the measurement disturbance view of the uncertainty relations using ‘weak measurement’ (i.e. measurements that don’t collapse the state onto its eigenvectors, so that an initial state is kept intact: an interference pattern would still be observed on a screen following a weak measurement, for example).2 The idea is to measure some individual system state (such as the polarization of a single photon) but also measure how much the measurement disturbs the state. By doing a weak measurement prior to another measurement, the effect of measurement’s kick can be determined (by making a third strong measurement of the first property weakly measured). The results in the experiments conducted so far have found less impact than Heisenberg predicted: measurement disturbance, according to these results, does not add much to the inbuilt uncertainty of quantum mechanics. Whether loopholes can be found or not (e.g. in the assumptions of weak measurements, and whether they in fact constitute measurement in a strong enough sense), it does show that what seemed to be a purely interpretative distinction (the extent to which uncertainty is an artefact of measurement or a feature of the world) can, in principle, be linked to experiment, thanks to a new tool."

# 7.3 EPR
"In the early days, as seen in the previous section, it was supposed that there was a ‘disturbance’ triggered by a measurement that ‘brought the value into being.’ In other words, the very act of observation was something special. That is, observation generates or produces the values we observe in measurements: those values weren’t realized in the system (were ‘indefinite’) before the measurement (unless the system had been expressly prepared in such a value by prior measurement). It was this feature that so disturbed Einstein – and not the statistical nature of the theory, as is often supposed (encapsulated in his ‘God does not play dice’ remark)."

Kochen Specker theorem:
[The Kochen-Specker Theorem (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kochen-specker/)

(VD)(Formalization of Hidden Variable HV) All observables defined for a QM system have definite values at all times.

(NC) If a QM system possesses a property (value of an observable), then it does so independently of any measurement context, i.e. independently of _how_ that value is eventually measured.

(O) There is a one-one correspondence between properties of a quantum system and projection operators on the system’s Hilbert space

The KS theorem establishes a contradiction between VD + NC + O and QM; thus, acceptance of QM logically forces us to renounce either VD or NC or O.



# 7.4 Cat

Measurment problem is implied by the following assumptions:

Definitenes of measured or observed properties

Linearity: time evolution under the Schrödinger equation is linear so that superpositions can ‘spread’ through interactions, so that if one system is in a superposition of its possible states, any system it interacts with will also evolve into a superposition of states;

Universality: the wavefunction ψ is able to describe any and all dynamical systems in nature.

  
[Why is linearity so important in Quantum Mechanics? : r/math (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/9n0dxc/why_is_linearity_so_important_in_quantum_mechanics/)

If there are non-linear operators in quantum mechanics (as suggested by [Weinberg](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491689902765)), then this allows for _real_ faster-than-light communication with an EPR pair (as pointed out by e.g. [Polchinski](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.397)).

"Also, assuming (big if) you could do an error free computation with a nonlinear quantum computer (Weinberg's model), then you can solve NP and #P complete problems in polynomial time. I suppose there's not a mathematical issue with this, but it's certainly an interesting consequence. [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9801041)"

"What is bizarre about this is that it is most often assumed that our experience (of macroscopic definiteness) is veridical (true to the facts of the world) so that if quantum mechanics is also true, then we are somehow affecting quantum states when we perform measurements. This is known as reduction of the wave packet by observation or measurement, or more formally as ‘the projection postulate.’ It is a solution alright, but requires filling in by some kind of mechanism to be satisfying. We mention a few of these here. The most famous (the one that ‘stuck’) is the Copenhagen interpretation."


Wigner's Friend,

Experiments: "the clicks on a scintillation screen in the two slit experiment; the large spatial separation between the beams of a Stern–Gerlach experiment, etc."

"Recall that the curious interference effects at the root of the double slit experiment and the measurement problem (and entanglement) come about from the existence of the quantum phase θ. If this can be reduced to zero somehow, then the curious phenomena disappear and the behavior looks classical. Decoherence is often touted as one route to the zeroing out of phase, and therefore interference, and therefore the measurement problem."

"But it is not a complete miracle cure. The idea is that when interactions occur between a microscopic system (with very few degrees of freedom) and a measuring device (lots of degrees of freedom), we also need to take into account the fact that both are situated in a wider environment with a vast number of degrees of freedom, and evolving according to the (linear) Schrödinger equation with respect to this environment. This environment thus has the effect of ‘absorbing’ the quantum interference through correlations with these degrees of freedom. The measured system thus engages in a multitude of other interactions with air molecules, photons, and what not, in such a way that in focusing on the apparatus alone one would be forgiven for thinking that it is in a mixed state (i.e. with good old classical probabilities for the alternatives), with no interference (between the alternatives) present at all. In other words, ‘for all practical purposes’ one has gotten rid of the problem."



## Principles

Realism: The wave function describes reality, and not merely statistical predictions.

Locality: Causality is only local within their respective timecones, and simultaneous events cannot effect eachother.

Independence of Experimental Setting: Experimental setting (such as the degree of rotation on a polarization filter) is freely determined by a scientist.

Completeness/Non-Local variables: The theory doesn't have any hidden variables that store information. 

Determinism: Initial conditions and the laws uniquely determine any later state of a system.
