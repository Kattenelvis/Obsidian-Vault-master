"Such thought experiments usually probe some foundational assumption, concerning space, time, locality, causality, determinism, matter, force, and so on. This kind of approach amounts to philosophical thinking (in the sense of conceptual analysis)."

"One can’t really do physics without making certain assumptions, however minimal, about how the theories one is using map onto reality (even if it is only mapping onto observable reality, as some believe [anti-realists, such as instrumentalists or constructive empiricists, who give unobservables the ‘silent treatment’], though even this is not so benign a claim as they think).[1]"

"One important factor is that the pre-Socratics, and those working before the Medieval period, relied on naked eye observations. There were no amplifications of vision as there have been since Galileo modified the looking glass (until then a simple gypsy toy) into a telescope for scientific usage. There was, in fact, no real experimental method. Some kinds of experiments could no doubt be said to have occurred, but this was not viewed as the royal road to worldly knowledge as it is today. This meant that theoretical structures were far more heavily based on what was delivered through the senses. However, as we will see in a moment, this wasn’t always the case, and unobservables invoked to explain observables can be found in theories in the earliest fragments of writing."

"For example, spacetime theories are presented through ‘models’ of the form <ℳ,$l^i$>  , consisting of some basic set of point-elements ℳ (a set of points with a certain size or cardinality) on which is imposed various levels of additional structure $l^i$ that let one talk about, e.g. the dimension of the space, the nearness of points, the distance of points, volumes, parallelism, and so on. This then provides the basic object whose mapping onto the world (or a world) we must, wearing our philosophy of physics hats, consider – that is, we must provide an interpretation."

"However, we can find strikingly similar dichotomies [in ancient physics] to those found in modern theories: discrete versus continuous space; infinite versus finite space; real time versus illusory time; eternal time versus beginning of time; plenum versus void; many worlds versus one world; and so on"

"There are also discussions of motion and its relationship with space and time, along with the ramifications a denial of the former has on the latter, and vice versa. Let us mention some of these views, since they provide a nice route into some of the more modern debates we discuss later."

Aristotle: Earth in center, copernican revolution destroys it with fact and logic

"In the Aristotelian universe there are five elements (Aether, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth) that have ‘natural places’ that determine their behaviors (natural motions) relative to the Earth’s frame. This is a teleological world in which things are guided by where they should be: fire wants to rise; earth wants to fall. This is a law of sorts, and it is based to some extent on observations. But it certainly doesn’t have same level of rigor of modern physical laws, nor does it strike one as particularly explanatory, nor does it seem capable of generating very interesting predictions."

"The notion of a natural motion (in which a body finds its ‘proper place’) and a ‘forced (or “violent”) motion’ (in which a body is taken off its proper course by some intervention) is the origin of the modern concepts of kinematics and dynamics respectively, which we will meet again."

"We needn’t trouble ourselves with questions of truth and realism; though connected, that’s strictly a separate matter. We can think about ‘model worlds’ (possible worlds) that ground the belief instead. Our own, actual world might be among this class of possible worlds, but it is not necessary in order to provide an interpretation (and an associated ontological picture)."


## 1.3

Comparing interpreting rorchard ink blots with interpreting physical theories. "What we are faced with in physics is not inkblots but mathematical structures of some kind. Just as with the Rorschach test different subjects will interpret the self-same blot in many and varied ways, so one and the same mathematical formalism can (very often) be understood in many different ways."

"But this isn’t a free for all: the ways one can interpret the formalism are highly constrained by the world (experience and experimental evidence) and by logical and mathematical consistency. However, even these tight constraints leave much elbow room, resulting in world-pictures entirely at odds with one another in all but empirical matters."

Interpreting Beethoven song S, "close enough" isomorphism with S* that one interprets. Multiplicity of interpretation. Tim Bayne and the push through construction? Maybe...

"“The question of interpretation [asks:] what would it be like for this theory to be true, and how could the world possibly be the way this theory says it is?”"
"The interpreter will then answer by specifying the class of possible worlds that make the theory true in the sense of satisfying the basic theoretical postulates (laws or axioms)"


Ulam:"Even the most idealistic point of view of mathematics as a pure creation of the human mind must be reconciled with the fact that the choice of definitions and axioms of geometry – in fact of most mathematical concepts – is the result of impressions obtained through our senses from external stimuli and inherently from observations and experiments in the ‘external world.’ ([51], p. 284)"

# 2 Symmetries

Special relativity has 2 meta laws:

1. Laws are covariant between inertial reference frames
2. The speed of light is constant

Thermodynamics has 1:

1. No laws can imply that there exists a perpetual motion machine



"These high-level laws are then defined by invariance with respect to some class of transformations (some way of shifting, rotating, evolving, twisting, or otherwise morphing the system), in which case we say that the laws in question are covariant with respect to those transformations – with the systems themselves then said to be invariant rather than covariant (the relevant quantities of the systems, such as energy or momentum, are then said to be conserved). In the case of special relativity above, the task was to find a set of transformation laws that preserve the principles (given that those principles seem to have a solid status in reality, as revealed by experiment)."
Lorentz Transformations

G Galilean relativity → The covariance of the equations of motion (laws) under Galilean transformations. 

SR Special relativity → The covariance of the equations of motion (laws) under Lorentz transformations.


# 3 Symmetries


"Such scenarios underlie many philosophical debates since there are both arguments for viewing the transformed states as physically distinct (despite their indistinguishability) and for viewing the transformed states as physically one and the same possibility (that is simply being represented in different ways)."

Galilean transformations form a group!!
"three parameters to describe spatial translations, a single parameter for temporal translation, reorientations about the three axes of space (three more parameters), and velocity ‘boosts’ in each of the three directions of space (another three parameters)."

Formally, we have a state $(x,t)$ such that we can apply a transformation such that it becomes $(Ax + vt+b, t+s)$ 

So for any solution x(t) on the position of some particle at time $t$, we can shift them with the transformations given above (for instance, $A\in SO(3)$ ) and still get the same solution. 

Same in intrinsic properties, but not extrinsic properties (except for the trivial transformation I'd presume). 

Equivalence class of models that explain similar systems (but in different positions, time's, rotations). This can limit the number of possible worlds. (Seems connected to humean vs non-humean laws worlds who are the exact same but with different laws cannot exist according to Humeans). As Leibniz say, is the world different if left and right swapped places?

THESE SYMMETRIES ARE CONNECTED WITH CONSERVED QUALITIES!!

Translation symmetry leads to conservation of momentum;

Time translation symmetry to conservation of energy; 

Rotation symmetry to conservation of angular momentum.

WOW

"If there weren’t these stable features under the various operations, then one could use the alterations to detect location, time, velocity, and orientation."

"That we cannot do this also points to features of the spatiotemporal system itself: it must be isotropic (with no preferred direction) and homogeneous (look the same everywhere and everywhen)."

"Naturally, the kinds of objects that are left most unperturbed under various operations (those that are most insensitive to a barrage of transformations that attempt to change them) are going to be homogeneous among themselves we find this even with quantum particles, which are identical in terms of their intrinsic properties, so that switching them leaves the laws of quantum mechanics none the wiser."

Only be committed to the equivalence class of possible worlds.

Geometric vs Dynamic symmetries

Geometric symmetries 
The symmetries of space, and that space is uniform (isotropic and homogeneous) and that events on space can be changed and still be uniform.

Dynamic Symmetries
include say a phase shift in the wave equation of particles. They still retain most of their properties despite that. 

Continuous vs discrete symmetries
Lie groups are continius symmetries

Global vs Local
"General relativity has such a local spacetime symmetry based on Diff(ℳ), the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold (spacetime, that is) these diffeomorphisms essentially just turn one manifold into another by moving the points of the spacetime manifold around. What this means, very roughly, is that the laws of general relativity (Einstein’s field equations for the gravitational field) are invariant with respect to any smooth transformation of the points of spacetime that keeps the structure of the spacetime manifold intact (which means, again very roughly, that the transformation does not end up ‘tearing’ the spacetime manifold or putting holes in it"


"To connect up to the discussion about laws, symmetries, and possible worlds: if we have some solution of the Einstein equations (which represents a possible world), then if we transform it by applying one of these diffeomorphisms we have ourselves another possible world that satisfies the laws of general relativity. In this sense, the group of diffeomorphisms is the symmetry group of the theory."

Passive and Active

Passive: The observer's reference frame is rotated, object is observed.
Active: The object is rotated, object is observed

Experimentally, in 1957, left and right ARE different:

"Counterintuitively, this symmetry (parity symmetry) is indeed violated, for certain lawlike processes (namely, those involving the so-called weak interaction). What we find is that electrons (or beta particles) in a beta decay process will preferentially be shot out of the South side (relative to a strong magnetic field) than the North side. The original experiment was carried out with Cobalt-60 atoms."




# 4.3


Twin Paradox. Both space farer and earth being will think the other one aged more than themselves. It seems like ourselves are stationary while the other one is traveling at near the speed of light, such that time dilation occurrs for the other one but not oneself. 

Resolution is by considering the acceleration and change in inertial reference frame from the space-farer. At the point of acceleration the relative "now" compared to earth will be immediately "skipped" assuming infinite acceleration (or really rapidly assuming finite acceleration).

But the problem is when you consider the possible topologies of space. Space could be shaped in such a way where going in one direction lends you back to where you started. A doughnut toplogy. Now how does it work, without any acceleration point if someone just travels in one direction?

"So here is an asymmetry: there are non-trivial (topological) differences in the quads’ trajectories. This causes differences in their frames and is already enough to dissolve the paradox."

Flaten out the square, tile the plane, calculate the length of worldlines (longer paths means less ageing).![[Pasted image 20240411225200.png]]



# 4.4 The hole argument


A lack of matter/energy in some region allows for an underdetermination in topology choice. A diffeomorphism can be made. This makes GR indeterministic, as a set of initial conditions (with a hole?) lead to different time-evolutions given different diffeomorphisms.

So that's quite the schock given Putnam's earlier argument for fatalism given SR. 




As we will see in §5.3, having multiple possible futures from some initial conditions amounts to indeterminism, and so it appears as though general relativity itself is indeterministic. For example, by running the initial state through the equations of general relativity (the laws), we might generate the world represented by the model ℳ, g, T or we might generate the world ℳ, *g, *T (where is a diffeomorphism, of which we have infinitely many to choose from, and * an operation that drags fields, such as g and T, around over the points of the manifold).


# 5.1


A finite disc world with a force that contracts objects as they approach the radius such that they don't notice it will measure an hyperbolic infinite world. But Fleincaré might posulate an theory that is underdetermined by that one: Forces that squish everything approaching the edge and is finite/euclidean. 


Spherical worlds are the same. You might return to where you started, or it was just so happened to be duplicated. 

"Reichenbach ([39], §17) has also extended this to other scientific facts at the basis of our theories, such as the uniformity of time (relating to the metric of time), which is based on the idea that we stipulate (by a ‘coordinative definition’) that, e.g. a pendulum’s swings cover equal periods of time– this is based on the fact that we can’t compare successive durations, there is simply no way to test such a thing:"

We may have to chose some convention based on simplicity, pragmatic utility etc. when it comes to the geometry of space and time. Do we have to accept anti-realism about geometry at all? Not so fast, we can claim that there is some true, non-inditerminate geometry and time. But that this is unkowable. 

"Another escape from anti-realism is to argue that, as with units, we know that there aren’t really two separate ‘theories of the world’ being offered: one and the same physical content is represented by both systems. This suggests treating a theory as a kind of equivalence class of its observationally identical presentations: theories are systems that tell us what we will observe and explain what we have observed."

T-duality in string theory, strings defined on radius R have a equivalent structure on one defined on 1/R. This is the same undetdetermination and  convention choice that plagues the structure of space.
