[Epistemic Utility Arguments for Epistemic Norms (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-utility/)

> **Consistency** If two propositions cannot both be true together, you should not believe both.


> **No Drop** If one proposition entails another, then your degree of belief in the first should not exceed your degree of belief in the second.

Dominance of two alternatives (taking umbrella dominates not taking it whether or not it's raining)

Dominance and  implies consistency

"Because we appeal to the purely _epistemic_ utility of the epistemic states we consider, rather than the _pragmatic_ or _practical_ utility of the outcomes of the choices they lead us to make, the arguments of epistemic utility theory are different from betting arguments or dutch book arguments for epistemic norms (Ramsey 1926 [1931]; de Finetti 1937 [1980]; see entry on [dutch book arguments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dutch-book/)). They are also different from the sort of axiomatic justification exemplified by Cox's theorem (Cox 1946, 1961; Paris 1994) as well as the sort of structural justification given by R. I. G. Hughes and Bas van Fraassen (1984) and Hannes Leitgeb (2021)."


Almost all epistemic utility arguments take on this form:
"
- **E** A set of conditions that a legitimate measure of epistemic utility must satisfy.

- **Q** A norm of standard utility theory (or decision theory), which is to be applied, using an epistemic utility function, to discover what rationality requires of an agent in a given situation."
  
For some epistemic norm $N$
$(E\wedge Q) \rightarrow N$


Example:

"**Epistemic Conservatism** W>R>0.

**Dominance** If one option strongly dominates another, rationality requires you not to choose the second.

Therefore,

**Consistency** If two propositions cannot both be true together, rationality requires that you should not believe both."

if one is right then R-W, and if neither is right then -2W, both are negative.


Idea: If the bayesian convergence theorems are true, and two agents have the same goal, then they will converge to the same actions.
SO INSTRUMENTAL CONVERGENCE?!

**"The Uniqueness Thesis** Given an agenda, the following holds: for any body of evidence, there is a unique epistemic state of the given sort concerning the propositions in that agenda that rationality requires you to have if that body of evidence is your total evidence."

"Epistemic Permissivism is simply the negation of the Uniqueness Thesis. So, for instance, the Uniqueness Thesis for credences says that, for any agenda and any body of evidence, there is a unique credence function over that agenda that rationality requires you to have in response to that evidence, while Epistemic Permissivism says that there is at least one body of evidence for which there is more than one credence function it is rational to have in response to that evidence."
