let it suffice to say that Rudolf Carnap’s Der logische Aufbau der Welt is like a breath of fresh air and that it is a paradigm case example of what philosophy should be like in the future. Indeed, this is my prediction: 80 years from now no philosopher will get away with doing philosophy without logical and mathematical means; it would be like doing modern theoretical physics without mathematics. There will be no trivial arguments, no hidden assumptions, no talking at cross purposes. Philosophy will be done in the way in which this young German does it, for it is the only way in which philosophy will make progress. I hear you say But there is no progress in philosophy—if only Carnap’s book had come out 80 years earlier…'






# ChatGPT on if I can formalize:

Prompt: Is there any branch of philosophy that can't in principle be formalized? And I really mean it, not just those who haven't currently been formalized, but those who even in principle can't be formalized. I want a proper, formal argument for why they can't be formalized, and not handwaving things like "the beauty of art" since the beauty of art is formalizable in formal logic

## Reply 1 (ChatGPT Disagrees)


The question you're asking is a profound one, and it touches upon deep issues about the nature of formalization and what it means for something to be "in principle" formalizable. I'll attempt to address it carefully and rigorously.

### Definitions and Clarifications

First, let’s define what we mean by "formalization":

- **Formalization** refers to the process of translating or representing a body of knowledge or reasoning in a formal system, typically using symbolic logic, mathematics, or some other rigorous framework with well-defined rules.
- **In principle** means that we are concerned not with current limitations in technology or understanding, but whether such a formalization could ever exist, given the limits of logic and mathematics themselves.

Now, what philosophical domains might be resistant to formalization, and why?

### 1. **Meta-Epistemology**: The Limits of Formalizing Self-Justification

Meta-epistemology examines the nature, scope, and limits of knowledge itself. The concept of self-justification (i.e., how a formal system can justify its own foundations) is where formalization reaches an inherent boundary.

#### Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems

Gödel’s incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently expressive formal system (like arithmetic) cannot prove its own consistency from within itself. This introduces a problem when trying to formalize epistemic systems that include their own reasoning mechanisms.

- **Formal Argument**:
    - Assume we have a formal system FF that aims to fully capture meta-epistemic reasoning.
    - By Gödel’s theorem, FF cannot prove its own consistency without stepping outside of itself.
    - Therefore, any attempt to fully formalize meta-epistemology will run into this limitation: it cannot capture the justification for its own rules of reasoning without appealing to a meta-system (which in turn faces the same issue).

Thus, the self-referential nature of meta-epistemology suggests that **it cannot be fully formalized** because any formal system used to represent it would be incomplete with respect to its own foundations.

### 2. **Phenomenology and First-Person Experience**

Phenomenology, especially in the tradition of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, focuses on the structures of subjective experience, emphasizing the first-person, lived experience (the _qualia_) which is directly apprehended by the subject.

- **Formal Argument**:
    - Formalization requires an objective description—e.g., representing states, relations, and operations in a formal language.
    - Phenomenology insists that first-person experience is irreducibly subjective, and that the essence of consciousness is not "about" objective relations, but about **how things appear to the subject**.
    - Any formalization would objectify the first-person perspective, transforming it into a third-person description, thus **losing the essential subjective nature** of the phenomenon it is trying to describe.
    - Therefore, phenomenology resists formalization because it is **ontologically different** from the kinds of things that formal systems describe.

#### Supporting Thought Experiment:

Imagine attempting to formalize the experience of "redness." A formal system can represent the concept of "red" as a property, but it cannot capture the _experience_ of redness itself—what it is like for the subject to perceive red. That subjective "what it is like" (qualia) evades formal capture.

### 3. **Moral Particularism**

Moral particularism, a view defended by Jonathan Dancy, holds that moral reasoning cannot be reduced to a set of universal principles or rules. Each moral situation is unique and must be judged on its particular features, without reference to formal, generalizable principles.

- **Formal Argument**:
    - Formalization requires general rules that can be applied across different cases (e.g., "murder is wrong" as a universal moral rule).
    - Moral particularism denies the existence of such rules, arguing that **context determines moral rightness**, and no formal rule can anticipate all the nuances of every possible moral situation.
    - If there are no universal rules or principles to formalize, then moral particularism by definition **resists formalization**, as any attempt to do so would miss the particularities that determine moral judgments in each individual case.

### 4. **Wittgenstein’s Critique of Rule-Following**

In his later philosophy, Ludwig Wittgenstein critiqued the idea that rule-following (and meaning) can be entirely formalized. His famous discussion of "following a rule" in _Philosophical Investigations_ suggests that understanding a rule is not reducible to a set of formal instructions because following a rule is an activity embedded in social and practical contexts.

- **Formal Argument**:
    - Suppose you try to formalize the act of following a rule by specifying a set of formal procedures.
    - Wittgenstein argues that rules are not self-interpreting; their application in new contexts requires **practical judgment** that cannot be fully captured by the rule itself.
    - Therefore, any formalization of rule-following would leave out the aspect of **practical understanding** that comes from being embedded in a human social context, which involves informal, contextual knowledge.
    - Hence, Wittgenstein’s critique implies that **rule-following cannot be fully formalized** because formal systems require rules to have clear applications, but human rule-following involves tacit, non-formalized understanding.

### 5. **Skeptical Theories of Knowledge**

Certain skeptical approaches to knowledge, especially radical skepticism, argue that knowledge itself cannot be fully captured or formalized because the very foundation of knowledge is in doubt. For example, Cartesian skepticism questions whether we can know anything beyond our own existence.

- **Formal Argument**:
    - Radical skepticism posits that any knowledge claim is subject to doubt.
    - To formalize knowledge, we need a system that can represent certainty or at least justified belief.
    - However, skepticism suggests that **no formal system** can ever prove or guarantee the truth of its own knowledge claims without assuming the very thing in question.
    - Therefore, skepticism resists formalization because it undermines the possibility of a foundational, formal system of knowledge.

### Conclusion: Philosophical Domains that Resist Formalization

- **Meta-epistemology**: Because self-justification leads to incompleteness.
- **Phenomenology**: Because subjective experience cannot be objectified without loss.
- **Moral particularism**: Because moral reasoning is context-dependent and lacks universal rules.
- **Wittgenstein’s critique of rule-following**: Because rule-following involves informal, contextual understanding.
- **Skeptical theories of knowledge**: Because knowledge itself may not be a formalizable concept.

Each of these areas offers a principled argument for why they resist or outright reject formalization, grounded in their own internal logic rather than just an appeal to intuition or the ineffable.


Added comment by me: There's a chance virtue ethics also counts. 

## Reply 2 (ChatGPT Agrees)

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no branch of philosophy that cannot, in principle, be formalized. Formalization involves representing the concepts, arguments, and theories of a philosophical domain using formal systems such as mathematical logic, symbolic notation, or computational models. While some areas of philosophy present significant challenges to formalization due to their abstract, subjective, or paradoxical nature, these challenges do not constitute insurmountable barriers in principle.

**Argument Against the Existence of Unformalizable Philosophical Branches:**

1. **Definition of Formalization:** Formalization requires that the concepts and propositions of a domain be expressible in a formal language with well-defined syntax and semantics.
    
2. **Expressibility of Philosophical Concepts:** Philosophical concepts, regardless of their complexity or abstraction, can be articulated using language. If they can be articulated, they can be symbolically represented.
    
3. **Construction of Formal Systems:** For any set of symbols and rules (axioms and inference rules), a formal system can be constructed to manipulate those symbols according to those rules.
    
4. **Extension to Complex Concepts:** Even concepts dealing with subjectivity, consciousness, or paradox (e.g., phenomenology, existentialism, or metaphysics) have been approached using formal methods in logic, mathematics, and computer science.
    
5. **No Inherent Barrier:** There is no inherent property of any philosophical branch that renders its concepts absolutely inexpressible or unrepresentable in any formal system.
    
6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, all branches of philosophy can, in principle, be formalized.
    

**Addressing Potential Objections:**

- **Subjectivity and Ineffability:** Some might argue that subjective experiences or ineffable concepts cannot be formalized. However, subjective states can be represented using formal models in fields like cognitive science and artificial intelligence. The concept of ineffability itself can be formalized by defining it as a property within a formal system (e.g., "A proposition PP is ineffable if it cannot be expressed within language LL").
    
- **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems:** While Gödel's theorems demonstrate limitations within formal systems (e.g., there are true statements that cannot be proven within the system), they do not preclude the formalization of entire philosophical branches. They simply highlight that no single formal system can capture all truths about arithmetic, let alone all philosophical truths.
    
- **Paradoxes and Self-Reference:** Philosophical paradoxes (like the Liar Paradox) present challenges but have been rigorously studied within formal frameworks like non-classical logics, which adjust the laws of logic to accommodate such paradoxes.
    

**Examples of Formalization in Challenging Areas:**

- **Phenomenology:** Attempts have been made to formalize aspects of consciousness and experience using modal logic and computational models, capturing essential features of subjective phenomena.
    
- **Ethics and Aesthetics:** Formal ethical theories use deontic logic to represent moral obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. Aesthetics can be explored using formal models that represent aesthetic values and preferences.
    
- **Existentialism and Hermeneutics:** While deeply rooted in individual experience and interpretation, formal methods like game theory and formal semantics have been applied to model decision-making and meaning interpretation.
    

**Conclusion:**

Given the capacity of formal systems to represent and manipulate symbols according to defined rules, and the ability to extend these systems to encompass increasingly abstract and complex concepts, there is no principled reason why any branch of philosophy cannot be formalized. The challenges lie in developing sufficiently rich and flexible formal systems, not in any inherent unformalizability of the philosophical domains themselves.
