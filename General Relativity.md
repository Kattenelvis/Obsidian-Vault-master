Gauge theories are also important in explaining [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") in the theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). Its case is somewhat unusual in that the gauge field is a tensor, the [Lanczos tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_tensor "Lanczos tensor").

This question is terrible, it lead me into a several day rabbithole lmao couldn't stop thinking about it :sweat_smile:. I'm not super good at GR so this might be wrong. 

The B theory of time: Events are referred by their relation to other events without a privileged "now". Ei < Ej iff Ei happened before Ej.
 
Big Bang theory: A theorem in general relativity which has a spacetime structure whereby every event is defined as a point on the 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold. That is, every event is defined in relation to other events without a privileged "now" with  exists paths between points:

"A spacelike curve is a path you could trace out between two points at an instant in time.
A timelike curve is simply a path that a material particle could take in spacetime.
A null curve is a path that light would follow through spacetime. 
A curve which has either timelike or null tangent vectors at each point is called a causal curve."[1]

While this seems to imply that the big bang theory can only work on the B-theory of time, some seem to disagree with this 

"Instead of describing geometrical space in four-dimensional space-time, Crisp suggests a three-dimensional space that evolves through time. This paired with the notion that at least one model of general relativity combined with Presentism allows for a preferred hypersurface."[2]

It's unclear (to me) whether or not Hawking's singularity theorem still holds with such an A-theory of time. It MIGHT not hold since one of the assumptions would no longer hold. This might mean that the B theory of time is a necessary condition for the big bang theory to hold, atleast in general relativity.

Solipsism: There's exists only one subject, the set of all phenomenal experiences is experienced by one subject.

Since neither the B-theory of time nor General relativity contain phenomenal experience as a part of their ontology, I will have to say that they can't form sentences about phenomenal experience and thus can't imply them logically. This is unless experiential sentences that posit multiple subjects are contradictory with big bang and the B-theory of time. 

Let there exists two subjects S1 and S2 with separate phenomenal experience. Assume S1 and S2 are located spacetime a(S1) and a(S2) respectively at time t. Assume that if two subjects are located at different places in spacetime then they will have different phenomenal experience. Then if big bang is true, then at the point of singularity (t=0), a(S1) = a(S2). This means they will have the same phenomenal experience. But we assumed that S1 and S2 were separate phenomenal experiences. This is contradictory. 

Therefore, B theory of time and the theory of big bang do imply solipsism.

This question is terrible, it lead me into a several day rabbit hole lmao couldn't stop thinking about it :sweat_smile:. I'm not super good at general relativity (GR) so this might be poor reasoning. 

The B theory of time: Events are referred by their relation to other events without a privileged "now". Ei < Ej < Ek iff Ei happened between Ei and Ek.
 
Big Bang theory/Hawking's singularity theorem: A theorem in general relativity that states that every past-directed timelike curve (a curve between points a and b on spacetime such that b is earlier than a) has a maximum length, given proper spacetime structure ("globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold").

In GR, "events" are defined to be points on spacetime. One can see that every event is defined in relation to other events without a privileged "now" with the existence of continuous curves between points:

"A spacelike curve is a path you could trace out between two points at an instant in time.
A timelike curve is simply a path that a material particle could take in spacetime.
A null curve is a path that light would follow through spacetime. 
A curve which has either timelike or null tangent vectors at each point is called a causal curve."[1]

While this seems to imply that the GR can only work on the B-theory of time, some seem to potentially disagree with this:

"Instead of describing geometrical space in four-dimensional space-time, Crisp suggests a three-dimensional space that evolves through time. This paired with the notion that at least one model of general relativity combined with Presentism allows for a preferred hypersurface."[2]

It's unclear (to me) whether or not Hawking's singularity theorem still holds with such an A-theory of time. It MIGHT not hold since one of the assumptions (predictability)[1] would no longer hold. This might mean that the B theory of time is a necessary condition for the big bang theory to hold.

Solipsism: There's exists only one subject, the set of all phenomenal experiences is experienced by one subject.

Since neither the B-theory of time nor General relativity contain phenomenal experience as a part of their ontology, they can't form sentences about phenomenal experience and thus those languages can't imply them logically. The original question can thus only be answered if experiential sentences that posit multiple subjects are contradictory with big bang and the B-theory of time. 

Let there exists two subjects S1 and S2 with separate phenomenal experience i.e S1 =/= S2. Assume S1 and S2 are located in spacetime at a(S1) and a(S2) respectively at time t. Assume that if two subjects are located at the same point in spacetime, then it's just the same phenomenal experience i.e a(S1) = a(S2) --> S1 = S2. Then if Hawking's singularity theorem is true, there exists a limit to the length on backwards space-time curves[1] for the subjects. Another assumption for big bang is that volume of space is expanding[1] which follows that past-directed timelike curves will have to end up at smaller and smaller regions of spacetime and that they eventually meet in the limit. Thus at the limit as time approaches 0, a(S1) = a(S2) while S1 =/= S2 which contradicts our assumptions. 

Therefore, B theory of time and the theory of big bang and phenomenal experiences located in space-time do imply solipsism. Or I'm completely wrong lmao.
