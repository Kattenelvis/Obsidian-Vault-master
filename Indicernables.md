Imagine a universe with only 3 sphere's in perfect symetrical formation, then they have the exact same properties and relations to all other sphere's. Using Russell's theory of descriptions, the objects is equal to their properties and relations. Therefore 3 objects are equal to 1 object, which is a contradiction.

But AHA you say, such a universe is a contradiction so it doesn't exist and we have no problem. Well imagine a square shaped visual field of 4 circles such that there exists perfect symmetries between the objects. Using Russell's theory of descriptions, they are the same

Answer: After picking a coordinate system Â´on the visual field, then they have different properties. You don't simply choose a new coordinate system for each object. 

In that case the first paragraph might also turn out to be false if space absolutism is true (as contrary to space relativism).
