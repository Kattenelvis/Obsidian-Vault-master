Prerequisite Tree's to guide people which order to read articles in. Subsection prerequisites. 

People can click in pages/subsections. 

The trees are not to be confused with foundationalist theories of justification, they are merely a pedagogically good causal order of reading the articles. 

The pages can have a symbol for how much mathematics there are in the articles (more math means more prerequisites)
$\emptyset =$ No math
$\exists =$ Some math
$\forall =$ A lot of math
