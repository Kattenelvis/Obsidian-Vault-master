My five-week plan:

Church-Turing, Gaddy's argument, phenomenological arguments
Physical computation
Functionalism
Integrated Information Theory
Orthogonality Thesis and AI consciousness

I should have produced all five videos by 29:th december 2024. Which from writing this (24:th november 2024) should give me one week per video.
