"This idea should not be confused with _logical positivism_ or _logical empiricism_. A version of _logical positivism_ applied to likelihoods would hold that if two theories assign the same likelihood values to all possible evidence claims, then they are essentially the same theory, though they may be couched in different words. In short: _same likelihoods_ implies _same theory_. The view suggested here, however, is not _positivism_, but its inverse, which should be much less controversial: _different likelihoods_ implies _different theories_. That is, given that all of the relevant background and auxiliaries are made explicit (represented in ‘_b_’), if two scientists disagree significantly about the likelihoods of important evidence claims on a given hypothesis, they must understand the empirical content of that hypothesis quite differently. To that extent, though they may employ the same syntactic expressions, they use them to express empirically distinct hypotheses."
