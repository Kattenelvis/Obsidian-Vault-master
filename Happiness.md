1. I'd use formal phenomenology for that, but only some definitions of happiness can be mapped to a utility function. I do think that, as I write in my blog post, that happiness may not necessarily be the only thing one ought to maximize (nor is happiness not one but perhaps atleast 4 different concepts). So I'd rather take the approach of a more generalized preference relation R, and showing that only if R is, or is atleast "closely approximated by" a utility function U such that aRb iff U(a) < U(b), then we can talk about utility functions. Calculations are so much easier with utility functions. But yes, back at your question at hand. Happiness can be quantified by the 5 different concepts of happiness as:
    
    1. Hedonic Pleasure: Utilizing formal phenomenology, introspect on phenomena P which we call "hedonic pleasure", usually associated with things like chocholate, orgasm and heroin. It feels very good. It can be mapped onto a utility function, because they're usually less or more of it. Algedonic phenomenology is a different term for this approach.
    
    2. Life-satisfaction view: This one is more difficult. How satisfied one's life is, even with a lack of hedonic pleasure, can be tricky to quantify. Some studies to try to give some general accounts, such as health, education and meaningful career.
    
    3. Desire-Satisfaction view which demands that we're the most happy if and only if all desires are satisfied. This is easily mathematized by simply enumerating the number of desires satisfied. There may be other ways of calculating it though, suc as the ratio of satisfied to unsatisfied.

    4. Happy emotional states: Similar to 3, this view states we're happy iff we have a happy/positive emotional mental state. There are multiple happy emotional states, and they may be incomparable, thus making utility functions impossible. This includes surprise, serenity, pleasure, excitedness, calm meditative states e.t.c. May require multiple numbers, or perhaps is completely inconsumensurable.




idea: The hedonic pleasure account is what most accounts of happiness can be reduced too, including life-satisfaction and desire-satisfaction views.
