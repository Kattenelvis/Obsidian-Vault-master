"Heterophenomenology is put forth as the alternative to traditional [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") phenomenology, which Dennett calls "lone-wolf autophenomenology" to emphasize the fact that traditional phenomenology accepts the subject's self-reports as being authoritative. In contrast, heterophenomenology considers the subjects authoritative only about how things _seem_ to them. It does not dismiss the Cartesian first-person perspective, but rather [brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketing_(phenomenology) "Bracketing (phenomenology)") it so that it can be intersubjectively verified by empirical means, allowing it to be submitted as scientific evidence."
