"Heterophenomenology is put forth as the alternative to traditional [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") phenomenology, which Dennett calls "lone-wolf autophenomenology" to emphasize the fact that traditional phenomenology accepts the subject's self-reports as being authoritative. In contrast, heterophenomenology considers the subjects authoritative only about how things _seem_ to them. It does not dismiss the Cartesian first-person perspective, but rather [brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketing_(phenomenology) "Bracketing (phenomenology)") it so that it can be intersubjectively verified by empirical means, allowing it to be submitted as scientific evidence."

Peirce might have some good takes

Also Nelson Goodman "structure of appearance"

1. What I mean by a "phenomenological system" is a systematic treatment of experience whereby transcendent objects are reduced, broadly speaking, to immanent structures or justificatory practices like induction are reconstructed. A natural way to proceed in construction of such a system is to construct "in advance" all possible sensory atoms that can be given e.g. combinatorically from sensory universals. Although this is formally unproblematic, as Goodman demonstrated, it raises concerns about the range of _a priori_ knowledge that such a construction admits. Namely, it assumes we can determinately tell apart the aspects in which experiences can differ or be similar and their mutual relations (e.g. whether redness is always independent from squareness). While this has some appeal, as we do seem to be capable of spontaneously producing appearances along these lines (as in Hume's "missing shade" problem), anyone who has taken mind-altering substances or even had a fever will quickly recognize that this ability is quite volatile and thus attributing it epistemic fundamentality is suspect. On a sidenote, these kinds of purportedly _a priori_ property-individuation statements correspond to Husserl's "material a priori" and are sometimes called "Austrian a priori" because they were widely discussed by students of Brentano.

2. _[_04:16_]_
    
    Due to the concerns about property individuation raised above (which apply in phenomenology more than they do in metaphysics as it would be pointless to vacuously say that we _somehow_ discover realistic "phenomenal kinds" empirically in physics, neuroscience etc., because the very point of a phenomenological analysis is to reconstruct the general structure of empirical cognition), many philosophers became nominalists/particularists. These philosophers wish to reconstruct empirical concepts from the capacity of the mind to compare sensory particulars, which means "kinds" are not determined in advance, but rather a predictive (broadly speaking; maybe "scientific/theoretical" is a better term) statement about what sorts of universal-combinations are possible. A radical version of this position, empiricism (in the strict sense), simply identifies possibility in the relevant domain with actuality. Not only is this deeply counterintuitive, it also produces very real problems for reconstructing inductive practices (Goodman's NRI) and numerous crucial scientific concepts. This is an (unintended) flaw of Carnap's Aufbau too, as Goodman recognized and Carnap himself admitted in his Schlipp volume. This is a deep philosophical problem. Depending on the kind of nominalism involved, there are also formal issues (again raised by Goodman against Carnap) involved but they have more to do with questions of economy and elegance than genuine fundamental difficulties in my opinion. (ändrad)
    
3. _[_04:16_]_
    
    A resolution of this problem of "accidental coextensiveness" (or, which is equivalent, restoring notions like causality) requires reattributing "intensional content" (something which mediates their reference to the world) to property names/labels. Remaining strict particularists, we need to keep statements about relations between these contents, which are essentially universals by other names, open to revision, however. As it is (as far as I am concerned) impossible to bootstrap intensionality away, it is useful to posit an intrinsically contentful generic/structural predicate (perhaps derived from formal properties of experience) which is then linked to phenomenal predicates at the level of scientific theorizing. A paradigmatic instance of this strategy is Kant's philosophy of science where, ultimately, various qualitative properties are to be represented as dispositions of bodies to enact motion (i.e. spatial translation in an unit of time). Only the very summit of conceptual hierarchies (corresponding to the categories and the pure empirical predicate of motion) is _a priori_ determined. This structuralism inevitably leads to the possibility that particulars have some underlying intrinsic affinity to eachother outside of regularities in their spatio-temporal presentation. But, as in Kant, this noumenal underwriting (I hope that Kant's choice to call the noumena as he did is understandable at this point) of experience is either based on an ineffable insight or is unknowable. This is not to say that introspection is rejected altogether (as it is just another mode of experience), just that our descriptions of perception derive their intersubjectivity from mapping the relations between them onto a shared structure (Kant would argue that products of mind's own activity are degenerate in their capacity to be subjected to such a mapping, introducing an in principle distinction between hallucinations and perceptions, which is the crux of his 'refutation of idealism'). (ändrad)
    
4. _[_04:16_]_
    
    I'll just mention that, curiously but predictably, Carnap in his late, posthumously published writings on inductive logic was forced to introduce phenomenological postulates (B-postulates) corresponding to Husserl's material a priori. Kant's a priori is, however, entirely formal in the technical sense of no _a priori_ knowledge of material (qualitative) properties of sensory particulars being admitted. This is, no doubt, by design as anything else would simply trivialize Kant's answer to Hume (which is what happens on conceptualist/"internal realist" readings of Kant).




"Is at" is hard for Carnap's aufbau system to take into-account? Why? I already figured this out earlier: A distance d is expecting a certain temporal succession of experiences until one is there.
