### Ways forward[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_everything_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Ways forward")]

Rescher's proposal in "The Price of an Ultimate Theory" is to dualize the concept of explanation so that a fact can be explained either _derivationally_, by the premises which lead to it, or _systemically_, by the consequences which follow from it. With derivational explanation, a fact _t_ is explained when it is subsumed by some prior, more fundamental fact _t'_. With systemic explanation, _t_ is explained when it is a "best fit" for its consequences, where fitness is measured by uniformity, simplicity, connectedness, and other criteria conducive to systemic integration. Rescher concludes that while a theory of everything cannot be explained derivationally (since no deeper explanation can subsume it), it can be explained systemically by its capacity to integrate its consequences.

In his 1996 book _The Conscious Mind_,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything_(philosophy)#cite_note-5) [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers "David Chalmers") argues that a theory of everything must explain [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"), that consciousness does not logically [supervene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervene "Supervene") on the physical, and that therefore a fundamental theory in physics would not be a theory of everything. A truly final theory, he argues, needs not just physical properties and laws, but [phenomenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenal "Phenomenal") or protophenomenal properties and [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysical_parallelism "Psychophysical parallelism") laws explaining the relationship between physical processes and conscious experience. He concludes that "[o]nce we have a fundamental theory of consciousness to accompany a fundamental theory in physics, we may truly have a theory of everything." Developing such a theory will not be straightforward, he says, but "it ought to be possible in principle."

In "Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy",[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything_(philosophy)#cite_note-Walker2002-3) a 2002 essay in the _[Journal of Evolution and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Evolution_and_Technology "Journal of Evolution and Technology")_, [Mark Alan Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Alan_Walker "Mark Alan Walker") discusses modern responses to the question of how to reconcile "the apparent finitude of humans" with what he calls "the traditional telos of philosophy—the attempt to unite thought and Being, to arrive at absolute knowledge, at a final theory of everything." He contrasts two ways of closing this "gap between the ambitions of philosophy, and the abilities of human philosophers": a "deflationary" approach in which philosophy is "scaled down into something more human" and the attempt to achieve a theory of everything is abandoned, and an "inflationary", [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanist "Transhumanist") approach in which philosophers are "scaled up" by advanced technology into "super-intelligent beings" better able to pursue such a theory.

### Criticism[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_everything_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Criticism")]

In "Holistic Explanation and the Idea of a Grand Unified Theory",[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything_(philosophy)#cite_note-Rescher2006a-1) originally presented as a lecture in 1998, Rescher identifies two negative reactions to the idea of a unified, overarching theory: reductionism and rejectionism. Reductionism holds that large-scale philosophical issues can be meaningfully addressed only when divided into lesser components, while rejectionism holds that questions about such issues are illegitimate and unanswerable. Against reductionism, Rescher argues that explaining individual parts does not explain the coordinating structure of the whole, so that a collectivized approach is required. Against rejectionism, he argues that the question of the "reason" – the "why" – behind existence is pressing, important, and not obviously meaningless.
