The death of pragmatics?



In the movie "blah" the aliens have a special language with a ring. While we will probably not utilize the language as a way of "time traveling" through our 4D worm, we can still end up having very new ways of communicating in the future.

For instance, in Kripke's paradox, blah blah explanation. 

Here we can see that pragmatics play a big role in determining whether or not quus means 42+64=5 at some point. But with mathematical codes as a new language of the future, that may no longer be a thing. 

While it may be the end of pragmatics, and that a fully semantic language can be utilized instead between agents using mathematical protocols.

LLM's however, are decent at picking up pragmatics as of 2024-03-22. For instance, if you write "wow I truly adore that I have to endure this job every day!" I get this:

Me: "wow I truly adore that I have to endure this job every day!" Using your knowledge of pragmatics, is that a sarcastic sentence or not?


ChatGPT: Yes, based on the typical usage of language and the context provided, it's likely that the sentence is being used sarcastically. The phrase "I truly adore that I have to endure this job every day!" suggests a level of frustration or dissatisfaction with the job rather than genuine admiration. In everyday conversation, sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one truly means, and in this case, the speaker is expressing discontent with their job despite using positive language."

So pragmatics may not die. However as syntactic symbols such as /s is used on the internet as an [tone indicator] to indicate sarcasm, there may be no need for pragmatics if even syntax can handle it. In either case, negating a proposition is pretty much the same thing.

$p, /s\leftrightarrow \neg p$
