## Interplanetary, Interstellar and Intergalactic Law

Given that iron stars - or even black holes, can be utilized for energy very far into the future, how do we ensure that cooperation between agents are up?

Do we need institutions of law anymore or can each post-human agent, in their very high degrees of rationality, cooperate on their own terms?

Authority? How are laws enforced?

Speed of light as a limit of the centralized enforcement of Law?

Rule of Law possible?
