How do we optimize configurations of substance in the universe?

Whenever I eat a piece of chocolate, the nerve signals form a more optimized configuration given my preference relation (given that I preferer similar experience as before but with medium levels of hedonic pleasure). How do we optimize this to a large degree?

"1. UBI is becoming a necessity for the survival of the economy

   Not, mind you, just to save people's lives. But without it the economy would collapse
   
   Specificly, without consumers there would be little drive for this.
   
   
   The economy would collapse for teh rich too. Unless they're okay with returning to a closed market with barely any market innovation
  
   I don't think UBI is the only solution, but it's a good conversation starter at least"


Nah you did a good job in giving an overview over what may happen without UBI in the future of complete workplace automation as every cognitive and physical ability of humans is simulatable. There may be other ways of ensuring that market collapse doesn't occur, for instance a post-money socialist computerized economy with distribution based on need/aggregated preferences. However, the urgency of the situation (especially given the advanced seen in just the last 2 years) may imply that UBI is our best shot at preventing a kind of disaster that may happen if traditional redistributive welfare systems are in place where a progressive income tax fund social welfare payouts when the unemployed has minimum living necessities that can no longer be paid for, all while fewer people pay income taxes. I doubt any kind of economy where human cognitive labour is automated would not have market innovation, given that automating innovation would be cheap and easy.
