> 2.5.4 Function-AI The idea behind this approach is that cognitive functions such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, acting, communicating, and problem solving, are sepa rate but that intelligence as a whole is enabled by these functions. This can be said to be general approach to AI that stems from computer science. The AI book by Russell and Norvig (2021) illustrates this approach, as it intro duces several different computational approaches to solve issues regarding perception, reasoning, learning, etc. To illustrate this approach with the notation from above, there are moments i and j such that aiC = fC(piC) and ajH = fH(pjH), where fC â‰ˆ fH. Here, the functions f could cor respond to searching, learning, reasoning, etc. Examples of AGI-aspiring architectures, that can be seen as representing Function-AI, are **OpenCog (Goertzel et al., 2014a, 2014b), Sigma (Rosenbloom et al., 2016) and Soar (Laird, 2019).**




### General

With an so far limited overview of some narrow intelligences, we move over to a more general model. A general intelligence will be able to navigate more environments, and fulfil more goals. 
Then things like pattern recognition as a compression algorithm is an convergent instrumental goal for many other goals (atleast human goals), which makes it a decent proxy for measuring intelligence in humans. But it's not a part of the definition and justified a priori, that's figured out via empirical research.


So IQ is not the right measure for general intelligence, but is rather a metric sometimes used by humans. 


Will general AI simply be multiple narrow AI's connected?

As a first step, we may recognize that humans are
