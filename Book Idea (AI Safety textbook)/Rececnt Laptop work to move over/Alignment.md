[OpenAI o3 and Claude Alignment Faking — How doomed are we?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n6rF48PaJc&ab_channel=DoomDebates)

Why did it take until Omohundro 2008 for instrumental convergence? Why didn't any philosopher in ancient greece theorize about how a tiny set of means to a very large set of ends?


Raz’s Facilitative Principle:

> [w]hen we have an undefeated reason to take an action, we have reason to perform any one (but only one) of the possible (for us) alternative plans that facilitate its performance. (Raz 2005b)


_Joint Satisfiability_:

If _A_ ought to _x_ and _A_ ought to _y_, then it is possible for _A_ to [_x_ and _y_].
