As Goerzel 2010 writes, the post-singularity societies could have changes in some very unexpected areas. Many areas of human life is highly unoptimal for most humans, and can be improved by a superintelligence. 

For example, sexuality. One of Goertzels friends reports that he wants to remove his sexuality to better pursue transhumanist goals, despite what his wife thinks (although she could also in principle change her sexuality to be happier then, or change husband). 

However, it's important to note that for some people, one's sexuality can be an important to someone's self-image and constructed self. The idea that a post-human societies should get rid of all interesting expressions of sexuality and interesting scenarios involving kinks and fetishes is I think if not wrong, atleast aesthetically non-pleasing for me. I think he was limited by his own ability to imagine interesting sexual scenarios involving sci-fi, fantasy and other concepts, given his likely mostly kink-free heterosexuality. 


This really plays a role in a larger part of the aesthethic changes that we can imagine that a post-singularity society might come with. 

> "Art" may involve building baby universes or new AI systems or 9-dimensional meta-multiversal movies ... or scientific data-sets or theories or mathematical theorems ... or perfecting one's own array of mind-states ... or drawing pictures of trees on paper ... all of the above and many more! (Let infinity flowers bloom...!)



Another part of sub-optimality are emotional states of mind. The reason being that a rational decision $D$ such that action $D$ optimizes for some goal or general preference relation for $A$, and that $A$ knows that $D$ is more optimal in this regard, may for emotional reasons pick $E$, leading to suboptimal behaviour. 

This can be remedied by ensuring that, if we don't want go so far so as to abolish emotions, at the minimum atleast ensure that we can overrule our emotions in such a way so as to avoid sub-optimal outcomes. In the long run, this will likely lead to more friendly, less warfare focused civilization. The way we might be able to have some reason to believe this is because of game-theoretic reasons. In an iterated prisoners dilemma, it is rational to perform tit-for-tat with forgiveness as an strategy. We might never engage with forgiveness as a strategy if we feel broken, so we may aswell pick to keep being mean to our opponent. However this is a bad strategy in the long run, especially if the opponent is able to show willingness to cooperate. 


Idea: Instead of calling is "post-singularity", given that it might be gradual rather than a singularity point, perhaps something like the "post-human society". Don't just call it this, discuss this in a section on this topic and definitions.
