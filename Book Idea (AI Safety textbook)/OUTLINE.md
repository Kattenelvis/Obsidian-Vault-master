Goal: Make each chapter a separate blog post, work, iterate, a few years later I should have a book out. Finish the philosophy book first (most likely). 

Potential title: An opiniated introduction to the philosophy of AI.

Potential title: The philosophy of AI from a transhumanist and AI safety perspective.

Potential title: Philosophy of AI from first principles

Potential title: Computation, AI and Transhumanist philosophy from first principles

Potential title: Computation, AI and Alignment from first principles

Random thought: The microwave represents everything good about humanity

Outline ideas (ordering/prerequisites of chapters)

Introduction --> Mathematics/Logic/Computability --> Physics (physical realizability of computation) --> Mind (as an instance of realized computation w counter-args) --> Epistemological Engineering/History of AI/Language(LLM) --> Rationality --> Alignment --> Phil of Science --> Ethics --> Economics --> Political Philosophy --> Law --> Phil of Art


Idea: Incorporate mathematics/logic/computability more fluidly with the rest of the topics? We can atleast begin with say, the different notions of computation and perhaps the logical hierarchies, introducing the church-turing thesis and the equivalence of different notions of computation, and then directly moving on to its physical implementation? Alternatively atleast begin to write about complexity and complexity classes before moving on, especially as one paper argues that physical implementation is needed... yes let's do it in that direction.
