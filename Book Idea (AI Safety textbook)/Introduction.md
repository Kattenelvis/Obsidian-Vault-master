While writing this book I witnessed massive changes in the development of AI, from GPT-4, to Gemini, to DallE-3, Llama 2 etc. These advacements made AI models much more capable then they'd ever been before. Now is the time to do "philosophy on a deadline", before it's potentially too late. In this book, we will explore topics from the logic of computation as a foundation, which we will then implement in physical systems such as parts of the universe, followed by how it's implemented in the brain. 


I'd like to thank yadda yadda ChatGPT for balling ideas with (though the book was entirely written by me)
