While writing this book I witnessed massive changes in the development of AI, from GPT-4, to Gemini, to DallE-3, Llama 2 etc. These advacements made AI models much more capable then they'd ever been before. Now is the time to do "philosophy on a deadline", before it's potentially too late. In this book, we will explore topics from the logic of computation as a foundation, which we will then implement in physical systems such as parts of the universe, followed by how it's implemented in the brain. 


This book is based on a firmly naturalistic and scientifically informed philosophy, one which sees philosophy not necessarily as a foundation for science. A strong commitment to naturalism. Philosophy is not a foundation for science, but evolves simultaneously and symbiotically with it. Philosophy deals with the most abstract parts of scientific theories, description of theories in formal logic, and reduction relations. Philosophy also formalizes the scientific process and formalizes assumptions various theories make. Knowledge is formalized in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, likewise the philosophy of mind but with neuroscience (multiple realizability may be true though). 

This book will also be very firmly in the analytic tradition. Continentals may be dissapointed that I'm not citing their philosophers, but I will not bother going through them and I do not cite continental philosopers (TODO: insert exceptions here later if any). I will instead put most focus on scientists first, mathematicians second, analytic philosophers third and no one else after that. 

I'd like to thank yadda yadda ChatGPT for balling ideas with (though the book was entirely written by me)
