## Imprecise probabilities

One way to avoid utilizing just a single value for the probability of an event, we may choose to have a whole range of probabilities $P\subseteq[0,1]$. When performing calculations then, one may need a specific value, and there are multiple kinds of algorithms that have been developed for that. Some basic one's include averaging, taking the lowest one, or the maximum one. 

We will get back to this later, but it turns out that imprecise probabilities for rational decision theory leads to sunk costs and other nasty consequences. 



## Information Theory

Information! $I=1/log(p)$
Entropy $H$.
