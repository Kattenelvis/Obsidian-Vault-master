1. A consciousness exists

Reason to "good" explanation (not best)

1. Realism, there is an external world that is a good explanation for the long term structure of experience
2. Physicalism, operationally the cause-effect structure of the stable structure of experience
3. Atomism, operationally as the reduction of systems to their parts


zeroth postulate, related to the zeroth axiom: 


> The 0th postulate employs the assumptions of [realism](https://www.iit.wiki/glossary#h.2v5fky6ntlfw)—“there must be something ‘out there’ that is a substrate of consciousness”—and of [physicalism](https://www.iit.wiki/glossary#h.jtbdxiwp9igh)—“whatever that substrate turns out to be should be defined in terms of cause–effect power.” The 0th postulate also implicitly includes the assumption of [atomism](https://www.iit.wiki/glossary#h.rnq3v27h92i6) in that a full characterization of a substrate of consciousness must be in terms of cause–effect power “all the way down.”
