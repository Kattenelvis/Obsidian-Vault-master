[Cultural Evolution (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution-cultural/)


Two different research projects:
" “Cultural Evolutionary Theory”, as we understand it here, is most thoroughly exemplified in the ongoing research tradition initiated in the 1970s and early 1980s by Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman (1981) on the one hand, and Boyd & Richerson (1985, 2005; Richerson & Boyd 2005) on the other."

Idea: What about memetic merges? Wouldn't this make it quite different from the non-merges seen in evolutionary biology?


"“A struggle for life is constantly going on amongst the words and grammatical forms in each language. The better, the shorter, the easier forms are constantly gaining the upper hand, and they owe their success to their own inherent virtue”. (Darwin 1871: 60 [1877: 91], paraphrasing Müller 1870: 257)"

"Culture, they say, is

> information capable of affecting individuals’ behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning. (Richerson & Boyd 2005: 5)"

"Adopting “information” as the underlying basis of culture brings both risks and benefits (see related entries on [information](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information/), and [biological information](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/)). On the negative side, it is not clear how we are to understand the concept of information. Boyd and Richerson, for example, give what might look like a definition when they write that, by “information”, they mean

> any kind of mental state, conscious or not, that is acquired or modified by social learning and affects behavior. (Richerson & Boyd 2005: 5)"
