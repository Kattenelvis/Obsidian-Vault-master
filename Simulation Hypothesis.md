< idea>
A counter argument:

The probability of being in a simulated world is conditioned on there being about an equal number of conscious being in each simulation as in the main-universe. 

But the main-universe, especially if the proportion of ancestor simulations being low, may only be small.

Potentially conscious beings, assuming they are like in the main universe (another counter-argument against SH is similar to that of Boltzmann brains, there's nothing that says the physics of the outside universe has to act like within the experience)

We can formulate probabilistic arguments for Boltzmann brains and the Simulation Hypothesis. However I will argue that this doesn't quite work. Both aforementioned assumes an upper world with the same laws as the experiential one. 

It might be likely that I'm reliving my life as a simulation before. Even with a small probability that I'd do it, the amount of times would still be staggering given the amount of time I can live in the post-singularity.
