To be distinguished from cognitive science's learning theory which is an empirical study of learning, FLT includes "Philosophical terms for learning-theoretic epistemology include “logical reliability” (Kelly [1996], Glymour [1991]) and “means-ends epistemology” (Schulte [1999])."

The diagram below is like a flowchart with the black circle representing the question "is the raven black or white?"

But here is the gruesome rule, which doesn't work as well since if every emerald really is green, it never ends up being correct.

"For a proposed norm of inquiry, we can apply means-ends analysis to ask whether the norm helps or hinders the aims of inquiry. This was the spirit of Putnam’s critique of Carnap’s confirmation functions [Putnam 1963]: the thrust of his essay was that Carnap’s methods were not as reliable in detecting general patterns as other methods would be. More recently, learning theorists have investigated the power of Bayesian conditioning (see the entry on [Bayesian epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/)). John Earman has conjectured that if there is any reliable method for a given problem, then there is a reliable method that proceeds by Bayesian updating [Earman 1992, Ch.9, Sec.6]. Cory Juhl [1997] provided a partial confirmation of Earman’s conjecture: He proved that it holds when there are only two potential evidence items (e.g., “emerald is green” vs. “emerald is blue”). The general case is still open."
