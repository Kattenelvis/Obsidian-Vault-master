"we propose here a unifying hypothesis where the core pathology of the autistic brain is hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity of local neuronal circuits"


"Why is it common for Autistic people to have a greater affinity with numbers than letters or words?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/10jmqmt/why_is_it_common_for_autistic_people_to_have_a/

"That's not really true. Autistic people have a greater affinity towards subjects that give them subjective enjoyment and fulfillment. Whether that subject ends up being, numbers, words, horses, fabric types, etc., depends on the individual. Due to this monotropic interest in one or so subjects, autistic people tend to have a strong desire to make sense of their area of interest, which results in the "greater affinity" because they literally cannot help but try to understand and improve in their domain. It's just how we are. If you want to understand more, I recommend looking into the monotropic theory of autism.

You can also conceptualize autism is terms of humanistic psychology. The needs that are most salient for most autistic people are cognitive needs, aesthetic needs, self-actualization needs, and transcendence needs. In essence, autistic people have a strong need to understand and reason within parts of the world that they find intrinsically interesting and rewarding (meeting cognitive needs and self-actualization needs), to systemize and organize this knowledge in pleasing or self-stimulating ways (meeting aesthetic needs).

A common way us autistic folks express love and affection is by sharing information they we are passionate about (for instance, I like to rant about humanistic psychology lol), which relates to meeting transcendence needs, a strong desire to expand or send out parts of ourselves outside of ourselves, such as taking the information in our brains and throwing it onto others."

Third-person view for autistic people's sense of self: The self is analysed objectively and scientifically rather than through sense experience. 

Idea/Introspection: I personally do this. I analyse my personality based on research results in for example personality theory (and my location in the big five, the dark triad and autism coefficient) aswell as rejecting LGBTQ identities as confusing rather than helpful (and replacing them with being on various points of a statistical distribution of attraction/romanticism/asexuality aswell as blanchardian typology for gender identity). G-factor and crystalized intelligence aswel. 

"They do not consider themselves as their own best reference; their first-person perspective on themselves is not epistemically better than an external one. By contrast, neurotypical people consider themselves as the experts about their own self, and close others as knowing less about them than they do (Vazire, 2010)."

Neurotypicals think that they can accurately introspect on themselves, not realising the epistemic troubles of the lack of externalist constraints on such things. Another reason we need more autistic people in the gene pool. 

"“ASD may represent a particular instance in which the distinction between self and other is exceptionally strong”"
Does not happen to me atleast

" The affective approach seeks to establish deficits in the emotional
capacities of people with Autism which supposedly relates to conversational
and interactional impairments they evidence. But, the affective approach
fails to explain the anomalies in language usage exhibited by people with
Autism, as well as the predilection for repetitive behaviors they exhibit.
      On the other hand, cognitive approaches typically subscribe to the
"theory of mind" approach from psychology (Leslie 1987; Frith 1989). This
approach claims that part of having a normal mind is being able to entertain
a naive theory about the minds other individuals have as well. This approach
does account marginally for the impairment to conversational interactional
abilities, as well as tapping at the anomalies in speech of people with
Autism. But it has not accounted for the repetitive behavior of people with
Autism. Nevertheless, it is in the "theory of mind approach" that I find a
stepping-stone to microsociological theory."

" If the above assumptions are correct then the brain must provide the
setting wherein a neurological architecture is erected and developed which
supports the activities of the deductive, inductive, and abductive processes
underlying the socially constructed phenomena of meaning, mind, language,
self, and emotions. The application of logical inference theory to Autism
suggests that Autism is the result of an impairment in the brain's regulation
of the inferencing processes such that the likelihood of each mode of
inference being invoked and sustained, and the level of sensory information
processing available at each mode of inference is imbalanced. 

***This
imbalance favors the levels of deductive and abductive competence, while
reducing inductive competence to the point of being null.***"



[The autism-spectrum quotient (AQ): evidence from Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism, males and females, scientists and mathematicians - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11439754/)
"Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4% of men did so. Twice as many men (40%) as women (21%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6% of the student sample scored 32+ on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored."




Autists better at deliberate reasoning? Or atleast, they utilize it more, compared to intuition, according to dual process theory.
