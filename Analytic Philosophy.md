- Analytic philosophy developed as a reaction to vague, flumsy, unscientific continental and pre-continental philosophy. A good example is [[Carnap]]'s reaction to [[Heidegger]]. 

- [[The Vienna Circle]] got founded in the 1920s and lasted until WW2. It developed a philosophy of anti-metaphysics, [[empiricism]] and started to apply the recently invented tools of [[mathematical logic]] to formulate and to attempt to solve problems in philosophy that way. They laid the foundations of much of modern analytic philosophy. In the UK, in the outgrowth of British [[Idealism]],  [[Russell]] got very famous, and [[Wittgenstein]] and so on developed many new ideas in philosophy. America, however, was in the deep dispair of [[pragmatism]]. [[The Lvow-Warsaw]] school in Poland was also prominent with [[Tarski]] e.t.c. 
  
- What is known as the "linguistic turn" took place, where [[the philosophy of language]] got a central position. Words where to be analysed carefully in their usage. Wittgenstein, Russell, [[Frege]] and so on developed new philosophy of language theories, developed in part from [[Mill]].
  
- Post WW2, a lot of analytic philosophy started to get developed all over the world. But [[Quine]] showed up and destroyed a lot of the Vienna's circle's ideas of anti-metaphysics. [[The analytic-synthetic distinction]] was torn apart and the reduction of all [[propositions]] to sense-[[experience]] aswell. This lead to the slow embrace of [[Metaphysics]] by the analytics. 
  
- In contemporary analytic philosophy from the 1980s onward there has been massive developments and a large number of new [[logical systems]] have been invented. Temporal-, Epistemic-, Doxastic-, Free-, Intuitionistic-, Spatial- e.t.c e.t.c logic, aswell as Type-theory, Computability theory, lambda calculus e.t.c e.t.c. Massive attempts at applying those systems at philosophical questions have been undertaken, aswell as careful usage of language in non-mathematical analytic philosophy. It's a very active field of study. 

- [[Semantical theories]] aswell such as Chomsky grammar, Montague semantics, Multiple-worlds semantics, truth maker/bearer semantics e.t.c e.t.c

- The development of the philosophy of science such as Popperian [[falsificationism]], Carnap's [[verificationism]], [[the unity of science]], strong use of science in philosophical investigation, Kuhn's [[paradigm shifts]], debates in [[realism vs anti-realism]] e.t.c e.t.c
  
- Philosophy of mind, Functionalism, Computationalism, Connectivism, Epiphenomenalism. The 2010s saw the rise of panpsychist materialism (chalmers) and the analytic idealism counter movement (Hoffman, Kastrup). 

- After decades of secrecy, the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is no longer the only allowed interpretation by the late 80s and rival theories start to pop up such as Spontaneous Collapse, Superdeterminism, Multiple Worlds e.t.c.
  
- Many contemporary analytic philosophy scholars also work on the development, logic and safety of [[AGI]], aswell as the [[ethics]] of [[AI]] and [[AGI]]. Boström's book "Superintelligence" is a good introduction. 

- Development of Computational and Experimental philosophy, as an attempt to bring in some scientific methods into philosophy. Examples include computational models and bayesian nets for science, computational proof theory, descriptive ethics e.t.c.
  
- Simulation hypothesis, Boström making probabilistic arguments for it and Chalmers writing human+.
