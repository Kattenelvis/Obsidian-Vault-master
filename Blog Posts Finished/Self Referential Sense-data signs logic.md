We will sketch the construction of a formal system which contains self-referential sense-data symbols, which we will call SRSD. While in principle definable within itself without utilizing translations into natural language, no natural language is needed to define any of it, it is purely used for pedagogical purposes.

we will use $=_T$ to mean "identical after applying a translation". The entire system can in principle be built without it.

ðŸŸ¥ $=_{T}$ "Red region in visual space, square shaped"
ðŸŸ¦ $=_{T}$ "Blue region in visual space, square shaped"

As we can see, the symbols are self referential, in the fact that they denote themselves. We continue with multiple such symbols.

ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦ $=_T$ "Red region in visual space to the left of a blue region in visual space"

We could extend this to one's entire visual space. Here's an example from integrated information theory of an individual who drew his entire visual space at one point in time:

We can also talk of symbols that change over time, such as this one:

<detail>
![[redblue gif 1.gif]]
</detail>
$=_T$ "Rectangle region of visual space shifting between red and blue over time"

Which is thus a self-referential and formal description of David Chalmer's "dancing qualia" in his argument against eliminative functionalism. [source]

It's worth noting this system extends into sounds aswell.

![[520hz sine.wav]]
$=_T$ 520hz x db (decibel here is a variable depending on your volume etc.)

Note that we can expand this symbolic system up to one's own phenomenal consciousness at any given timestep. While I'd love to also give some examples of smells, tastes, proprioception etc. this is sadly the limit of current technology. 

The idea is to utilize SRSD to formulate the dynamics of multiple phenomenal consciousnesses which are inaccessible to each other (for instance, what seems to be the case between two humans, barring radical overlap). We can thus in principle describe say the experience of Billy at $t$ and Alice at time $t$ using this symbolic language. This allows us to extend the language into other important areas of the philosophy of mind, such as fusions and fissions (so two symbols become one or vice versa respectively), overlapping minds, inverse qualia (color symbols are swapped), dancing qualia (already described earlier). 

An important limitation worth mentioning is that SRSD might not be able to express qualia-substrate pairs for it cannot express substrates (since it's not able to express external-world objects beyond experience). 

This is only a sketch of such a system. It's slightly different from the set-theoretic version of phenomenal consciousness in [[3. Formal Phenomenology]] and [[theo ther one]], but the overall concept is quite similar: formalizing phenomenal consciousness in a formal logical system.

SRSD is inspired by Carnap's Aufbau, which I respect as one of the greatest philosophical projects of all time. We should strive towards a new formal logic system of phenomenal consciousness. I think it seems fairly likely that all concepts can be built up from phenomenal concepts like above, thus we could in principle have a self-contained philosophical system within SRSD. The idea is that all concepts terminate in descriptions of set data or a set of descriptions of sense data. Concepts that exist in circularity or in some holistic sense are meaningless. As a final note, Wittgenstein's private language argument does not hold here, for the correctness conditions are trivially satisfied. 









1. There exists an experience
2. An experience 

To avoid the ambiguities of natural language I formalise a system of philosophy within itself, defined in a formal language. 


x ---> [Black circle]
y --> [White circle]

xxxxxxxyyy
Objective frequency

"Me" and "You" Pronouns

Inverse qualia using those pronouns
"x Me y You"

z --> audio file 40db 1000hz sinewave

xAbovey   -->  [black circle above white circle]
xLefty e.t.c --> self explanatory
zLouderz' --> Two audiofiles one louder

A set 
{x,y}

Many circles with increasing radius, can map to differently sized sets which defines a size relation.


If modelled in FST, it's self-provably consistent and complete.
