Assume naturalism is true, i.e there exists a set of natural laws that update one's experience over time. Let $E$ be a set of all possible ways to experience (all possible combinations of sight, audio e.t.c). Let's say there's an update rule $T:E\rightarrow E$ from the set of experience to itself. If for example the visual field is an cellullar automata, then the rules that govern the change of the visual field from one timestep to the next is the natural laws (applied to visual experience). Let $E_t\in E$ be the experience at a timestep $t$. The rest of the article will assume that to be true.

Assuming Solipsism, the update rule for every time step would have to be shaped, basically completely brute force, in the following way:  $T(E_t) = E_{t+1}$ Where T is the update rule. This basically states that one's life is completely predetermined, painted before hand, by some unknown force. It means that there's one unique update rule for every timestep. Every single pixel on one's visual field, every decible-pitch combination in one's auditory field and so on and so forth is determined at every time-step throughout one's entire life.  This means that the number of rules is equal to the number of points of experience multiplied by number of timesteps, i.e $T|E_t|$ (Where $|E_t|$ is the size of the set $E_t$.

It is almost certainly the case that there is vastly more timesteps in one human lifespan than points of experience. With a basic rule however, such as some cellullar automata rule (or something like a hypergraph update rule as per wolfram's physics project) could be defined with only a few lines. Almost certainly less than 100, maybe even less than 10 rules. 

The generalised size of both ontologies is of the following way:
Number of rules + number of timesteps + number of points of experience

Then we get the following ontologies:

Size of Solipsism $= T|E_t| + T + T|E_t|$ 
Size of Idealism $= n + T + T|E_t|$

Now let's compare the sizes. 
The main theorem, "Idealism is more parsemonious than solipsism", can now be restated mathematically:

Size of Idealism $<$ Size of Solipsism  $\rightarrow n + T + T|E_t| < T|E_t| + T + T|E_t|$

Subtraction of similar terms of both sides yield
$n<T|E_t|$

Which is clearly true. 

In conclusion: Solipsism being true would imply fewer points of experience (like pixels in our visual field e.t.c), however the update rule would be vastly more complicated if solipsism is true. If you look into cellular automata (CA) for example, even a simple 1D CA such as rule 30 can perform Turing machine level computation. If the world is ran by a simple set of rules that gives rise to massive complexity, then we'd only need a few rules. But if solipsism is true, then the update rule must be vastly more complicated to update it to make it just happen to look like my entire life.
