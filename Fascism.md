The idea is that fascists employ and promote an impoverished vocabulary in order to push disingenuously simple ideas ("America First!"), stifle criticism ("Fake News!") or otherwise limit critical reasoning and force an orthodoxy on people without them really even noticing. Fascism is a populist movement: it requires millions of people to unite behind a single ethno-nationalist identity, and that's easier to achieve through simplistic, repeated slogans than through wordy essays. It's far more powerful to give your supporters a slogan with which to dismiss the opposition ("Scum Media!") - otherwise they'd have to engage using their own words and risk having their minds changed.

Fascism thrives in anti-intellectual environments, which is why you see fascists employ anti-intellectual tactics like conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, rejection of consensus, defunding education and the general dumbing down of society and culture including its language.

Many definitions of fascism include reference to this, including _Ur-Fascism_ by Umberto Eco:

> All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.

Eco was inspired by the the best fictional representation of this phenomenon, which is of course Newspeak from _Nineteen Eighty-Four_.

Here's one example of Newspeak and how it is intended to limit criticism and opposition, from the novel:

> _Comintern_ is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas _Communist International_ is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way, the associations called up by a word like _Minitrue_ are fewer and more controllable than those called up by Ministry of Truth. This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable.

The theory of Newspeak is rooted in something called [linguistic determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_determinism), which is the theory that language shapes how people think about things. A strong linguistic determinist would argue that certain cultures 'lack' certain feelings or concepts because their language doesn't have a word for them. This strong linguistic determinism is pretty much rejected by modern linguistics, but the consensus is that there probably is nevertheless a weak linguistic relativity that has _some_ effect on people's thoughts and (crucially) emotions, and this is what fascists seek to exploit.

Outside fiction and theory, you'll find loads of examples of fascists deliberately shaping language and discourse in this way.
