Russellian Monism
- Structuralism about Physics
- Quiddites as intrinisic property holders
- Quiddites are in some way involved in phenomenal consciousness.

> While all Russellian monists maintain that quiddities are relevant to consciousness ([section 1.1](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russellian-monism/#ThreCoreRussMoniThes)), some construe quiddities themselves as phenomenal properties

Implies panpsychism


Cosmophenomenological properties


Panprotopsychism



>On physicalist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural properties are physical (Stoljar 2001; Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015, 2019; Coleman 2012, 2015; Montero 2015; Morris 2016; Brown 2017). On idealist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural properties are mental (Bolender, 2001; Adams 2007; Schneider 2018; cf. Chalmers 1996: 155). On neutral monist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural properties are neutral, where neutral properties are neither physical nor mental but underlie both physical and mental properties (Nagel 1986, 1998; cf. Stoljar 2015; Wishon 2016; also see the discussion of _panqualityism_ in the entry [panpsychism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/)). Finally, Russellian monism could be combined with the traditional (e.g., Cartesian) dualist view that the concrete world includes two fundamentally distinct sorts of entities, the physical sort and the mental sort. This can be done by, for example, identifying structural properties with physical properties and quiddities with certain mental properties (cf. Chalmers 2010: 135).
