\section{Indeterminacy Quine}
The Indeterminacy of language thesis put forth by W.V Quine questions our ability to translate between languages, understand others, hold content in mental states such as beliefs and intentions, all the way to questioning knowledge itself.\cite{wright} There's two main arguments for this view, namely the argument from below, and the argument from above.\cite{iep-ind} This article will go over both arguments, and some counter-arguments that have been put forth. 

First it's worth noting that indeterminacy of translation is not about i.e "Schadenfreude" where translation directly between two words, in this case between English and German, is impossible. It is about the entire language being impossibly translatable. 

\subsection{Argument from above (Underdetermination)}
This argument generally goes about first showing that science is underdetermined, and then shows how language translation between theories lead to indeterminacy.\cite{iep-ind} First, some definitions. 

Some set of hypothesis's or theories are underdetermined whenever there exists multiple incompatible hypothesis's or theories that explain the same set of data. Formally: For any two theories $T_1$ and $T_2$, they are underdetermined by a set of observations $\{O_1,\dots O_n\}$ iff for any $O_i$, $T_1\vdash O_i$ and $T_2\vdash O_i$ and $T_1\cup T_2\vdash\bot$. 

The theories are radically underdetermined if even with all possible observation sentences, there are still multiple theories to select between. 

A translation $S_a$ is indeterminate if there is no correct way of translating $S_a$ into another language $S_b$.

Now for the main argument. Say you take some agent $A$, with the task of translating some native's $N$ theory $T_N$ into their own language. Since the  observation sentences provides the stimulus conditions for translation, $A$ translates them into language $A$ as $\{O_{N_1},\dots O_{N_n}\}$, they can be translated into $\{O_{A_1},\dots O_{A_n}\}$. Now let's say that $A$ believes that all these observation sentences are true, and attributes his own theory, $T_A$, as the theory that the native believes in. It cannot translate the theoretical sentences of the native's theory since they don't provide the stimulus conditions. Now, introduce an agent $B$. This agent also translates the observation sentences from the native's language into the same language as $A$. However, $B$, despite also believing in $T_A$, attributes $T_B$ as the theory that the native believe in. $B$ and $A$ might believe that $T_B$ is unnatural or less parsimonious than $T_A$. Since the observation sentences are underdetermined, multiple theories are implied by the observation sentences. Thus, we have indeterminacy in translation, there is no way of choosing the correct translation. 

This argument is also a part of Quine's physicalist commitments, since it shows that facts about meaning are made-up, and not a part of a physical universe with only physical objects. It is also somewhat reminiscent of his logical positivist past, in the sense that facts about meaning are unverifiable nonsense. \cite{sep-quine}

\subsection{Responding to argument from above}
Wrights responded to the argument by stating that \cite{wright}

Another critique is that the argument from below, which has the same conclusion as the argument from above, is a premise for the argument from above. Now let's go over the argument from below. Quine himself stated that the argument from above was his more important and stronger argument, but his argument from below is still important.

\subsection{Argument from Below}
Imagine that you're a field linguist trying to understand a language in some foreign part of the world. This language has no history or similarity to your language, and the language could be odd or unintuitive in any number of ways. Imagine now that there's a stimilus condition of some rabbit that's jumping somewhere, a native points at it and says "Gavagai". An utterance of the type "Gavagai" could mean any of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rabbit!
    \item Look, a rabbit!
    \item That is a rabbit
\end{enumerate}

A linguist can then create hypothesises regarding what 'gavagai' means and then exclude some of them given new observational data as more stimulus-utterance combinations are made. 

But the linguist can just keep creating hypothesises:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rabbit Fusion (mereological fusion of all rabits) 
    \item Undetached Rabbit part
    \item Temporal stage of a rabbit
    \item Rabbit-tree-ground fusion
    \item Rabbiting
    \item Instatiation of Rabbithood
\end{enumerate}

How is one to distinguish between these, and the possibly countless many other potential examples? Maybe one can find the natives use of "Yes" (Assent) and "No" (Dissent) in the language. How to figure out? And even if it is it isn't enough.

But let's assume that one can find a question-word such as "qua" which means "how many". In this case, we could atleast rule out say, 'Rabbiting', since "how many rabbiting" doesn't even make sense, and you'd get dissent from the natives. However, this does not rule out a very large number of other options, such as rabbit-fusion or rabbit-tree-ground fusion and so on. There, "qua gavagai" could mean say, "how many rabbit fusions are there?" and the answer would be one aswell. Of course, this would always be one. But the point Quine is making is that there's always more meanings gavagai could take than what's ever possibly exhaustable by the evidence. Keep in mind this is still with the assumption that the meaning of "qua" and atleast one dissent/assent are known. 

The radical conclusion of this is that even after a lot of evidence-gathering and hypothesis testing, for say, 20 years, the linguist will still not come to a full understanding of the language. By assumption 2, native speakers wouldn't be able to understand the language either. So there's indeterminacy among everyone. And if meaning is hopelessly indeterminate, then so are the truth conditions, the contents of mental states (such as beliefs and intentions), and thus knowledge. This is why this argument is generally considered to be a skeptical argument.  

One might think that a way of finding out which use is the correct one for gavagai, is to make the natives assent or dissent in various ways. Such as asking questions regarding their views on temporality, forms, and mereology when it comes to the word 'gavagai'. However, the main problem with this response is that if you cannot even figure out basic exclamations such as 'gavagai', what luck do you have with more complicated and abstract things? 

Quine believed in the use-theory of meaning. Words have meaning insofar as they are used in certain stimulus conditions. 

Whenever you ask a question such as "how many gavagai", say "qua gavagai", then if that really means "how many" then this would indeed rule out say "undetached rabbit part". But it would not rule out that the question might be "of how many rabbits, how many undetached rabbit parts are there?". Similarly, if 'gavagai' means 'rabbit fusion', then asking how many will always get you an answer one. But if qua means "of how many rabbit-parts of rabbit fusion is there" you'd get a different answer whenever there's more than one part of rabbit-fusion. 

However it is crucial to point out that there are two underlying assumptions in the argument from below.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Meanings must be public. I cannot know what my expressions mean unless you have nough data regarding my linguistic behaviour in an environment to figure out said meaning too.
    \item Language aquisition by children cannot be richer than the methodology employed by radical translation. 
\end{enumerate} 

Neither proposal is considered uncontroversially true, but generally considered true. Chomsky might have problems with 2. given his views on language acquisition \cite{iep-ind}.


\subsubsection{Evans argument}

Evans made an argument against this.\cite{wright} Weak interdeterminancy vs strong interdeterminancy. 
Weak: Some questions about the meaning of an expression is indeterminate.
Strong: All questions about the meaning of an expression is indeterminate.
Wright asks, which type of indeterminancy does Quine's thesis imply?


You can have multiple ways of ruling out meaning-hypothesises by using more terms. Imagine that there's two more terms, "reegn" and "earlong", roughly meaning something like green and long ears respectively. Situtations which prompt say "reegn" and "gavagai" might exist simultaneously when there is something rabbit-like and something green like, while "reegn gavagai" is only assented when there is a green rabbit. In a similar ways, natives might assent to "reegn gavagai" and "earlong gavagai" only when there's a green rabbit and an long-eared rabbit, but only assents to "earlong reegn gavagai" when there's a green rabbit with long ears. 

Evans then argues that using a system similar to this, one can rule out a lot of possible meanings for gavagai. For example, if gavagai mean "rabbiting" and "reegn" means "it is greening", then "reegn gavagai" can only be interpreted as the conjunction (such as it is windy and it is raining) and not "it is greening rabbiting" which makes no sense. Similarly, whenever say an the stimulus conditions is that there is a rabbit with a green arm, then the assent of "reegn gavagai" under those stimulus conditions and perhaps "neg reegn gavagai" when no part is green, implies that gavagai means part of rabbit. 

There's still weak indeterminancy, but not strong as Quine argued.
