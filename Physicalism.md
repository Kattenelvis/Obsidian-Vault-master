Generalized version: We can have a fully formalized/mathematized theory of consciousness, of which we can input some physical state, of which we derive some phenomenal state (say in formal phenomenology, or Q-structures from IIT etc). We do not experience the structure itself. We can have it all, the theory T, physical structure $P_1,...P_n$, of which the phenomenal structure $M_1,...M_m$ such that $T,P_1,...P_n\models M_1,...M_m$ yet we don't experience $M_1,...M_m$. An experience machine might be hooked up to experience it, which is different, and leads to experience change. Knowledge comes in especially if there's some part of the derived experience $M_i$ such that oneself don't experience nor have memories of $M_i$. As such experiencing $M_i$ gives information or knowledge as a unique phenomenal experience.
