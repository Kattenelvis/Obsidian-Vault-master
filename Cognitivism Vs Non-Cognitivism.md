Ayer's theory: "X is bad" is equivalent to "Boo X!" and "X is good" is equivalent to "YAY X!". Moral propositions only express emotions (emotivism). 


> More recent forms of normative non-cognitivism have recast their doctrines somewhat to describe them as “expressivist” (Blackburn 1993; Gibbard 1990). From this starting point Huw Price (1988) has sought to generalize expressivism to include not only normative language but other kinds as well. In some more recent expositions of this proposed globalized expressivism or “functional pluralism” (Price 1997; see also Creath 1994 on the sense on which Carnap’s view can be called “functionalist”), he invokes Carnap’s conception of mathematics as the exemplar on which he proposes to model his approach to all sectors of language; he calls this the “Carnap thesis”, and assigns it fundamental importance in the development of a new “global expressivism” as he also calls his position (Price 2013, 2018). In view of the discussion above, it would seem that Carnap himself had already generalized his functionalist “Carnap thesis” regarding mathematics to at least values and possibly also to other sectors of language (Carus 2018; Price 2018). This is also consistent with the new-found interest in Carnap’s “inferentialism” (Peregrin 2011, forthcoming; Chalmers 2012), discussed further in [section 5](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carnap/#LogiSyntLang) below. Perhaps, in some respects, current philosophy is beginning to catch up to Carnap.

(General surveys of Carnap’s work can be found in, e.g., Mormann 2000, Friedman and Creath 2007.)
