Substantiavilism: One can arbitrarily quantify over spatial points, they exist on their own right

Reductive relationism: Points/regions are a set theoretic construction out of physical objects and their parts.

Elminative relationism: Cannot quantify over regions or points at all, atleast unoccupied regions


Yes so basically, this is a debate that pretty much started with a letter exchange between Newton and Leibniz. My understanding might be innacurate and sorry if so. Newton argued that the universe had an absolute coordinate system with a center that all objects would move in relation too. So every object had an absolute position that can be described with an (x,y,z) vector in cartesian cordinates. In predicate logic, we could say that "Being at (x,y,z)" is a one-variable predicate. So for example, "Being at (100,200,300)(James)" is true iff James is at position (100,200,300) in absolute coordinate space. Leibniz, on the other hand, believed that position was a relational property between objects. So instead, it is a property of the monads that they are spaced from eachother as a relation. In predicate logic, we could say that "Being at (x,y,z)" is a two-variable predicate (relation) between the objects. So "James, relative to Carl, is at (100,200,300)" is true iff James really is spaced that distance from Carl. The debate was seriously shaped by Einstein, and most philosophers and physicists since then are relativists. But the new viewpoint of Substantivialism emerged instead, with an absolute space-time coordinate system instead (x,y,z,t). However the hole argument seems to purport that many types of space-time substantivialism is false, because it fails to lead deterministic, unique laws with the Einstein field equations.
