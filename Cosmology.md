https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model
Potential problemd for the $\Lambda CDM$ model is that it assumes $k=0$ (i.e flat, infinitely spanning universe). [[Digital Phenomenology]] states that infinities don't exist, so according to DP it is more likely that the universe is of spherical shape and thus $k>0$.
