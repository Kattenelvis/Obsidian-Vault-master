[Principle of Sufficient Reason (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/)

Restricted in different ways, such as over actual objects instead of all possibilia, or propositions and not objects or their properties. "A variant of the PSR restricted to entities might require an explanation for the existence _and_ non-existence of entities, or it might be further restricted by requiring a reason only for the existence (or only for the non-existence) of entities. A version of the PSR that is restricted to propositions might range over both contingent and necessary propositions, or it might be further restricted to only one of these sub-domains."

"Frequently, the relation of providing a reason is conceived as irreflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, though each of these ... have been challenged."
"The relation of providing a reason can be conceived as an ontological relation (as in contemporary discussions of ground), or as a purely epistemological relation."

First problem: Which of the different PSR's with different modal strengths is preferable over all the other versions and why?

Second problem: "One of the most interesting questions regarding the PSR is why accept it at all. Insofar as the PSR stipulates that all things must be explainable, it seems that the PSR itself demands an explanation. Several modern philosophers attempted to provide a proof for the PSR, though so far these attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Another important question related to the PSR is the possibility of self-explanatory facts and self-caused entities; particularly, one might wonder how these are distinguished from unexplainable, brute facts and uncaused entities. One might also wonder whether the PSR allows for any _primitive concepts_ that cannot be further explained."

"A third crucial problem for proponents of the PSR is how to address the Agrippan Trilemma between the apparently exhaustive three horns of: (i) acceptance of brute facts, (ii) acceptance of an infinite regress of explanation (or grounding), or (iii) acceptance of self-explanatory facts. _Prima facie_, each horn in the trilemma undermines the position of the proponent of the PSR."

What if, given the PSR, we had no reason for the existence nor inexistence of $x$? If one also accepts bivalence, then such cannot be the case. 

Leibniz and Spinoza, "Among the alleged consequences of the Principle are: the Identity of Indiscernibles, necessitarianism, the relativity of space and time, the existence of a self-necessitated Being (i.e., God), and the Principle of Plenitude"



Radical monism  youtube video here, PSR implies monism and then undermines itself?

PSR is used to demonstrate the cosmological argument for the existence of God [[Cosmological Argument]]

Argument against this:

Nothing says $q$ has to be contingent, it could be necessary, in which case we get an explanation:
$q\equiv \square p$
Since $\square p \rightarrow p$ it is a sufficient reason for it.
