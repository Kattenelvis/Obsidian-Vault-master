The best VR experience I had was walking in this circular shaped park. Music was playing, some kind of ethereal music, probably lo-fi hi-hop which was popular at the time. It was very bright, the surrounding area and the trees in the middle where a combination of autumn leaves and cherry blossoms, giving this bright orange-yellow-pink color over the entire map. There were some statues near spawn, and when you went down the path further were a log cabin. Inside of it were a TV to connect to the internet and there were pillows and a fireplace. It was one of the most serene, ethereal and beautiful experiences I've had. 

This is how I imagine the far future the most. Not with Dyson spheres, matryoshka brains or intergalactic empires. Now don't get me wrong, Dyson spheres will be needed to run these simulations on large scales. But being a post-human inside of such a simulation one would never notice such structures. 

What I desperately want to avoid is the following: Extinctions, Forcing values, forced suffering, and a Darwinian apocalypse. 

First, the risk of extinction, or X-risks as they're sometimes called.

Secondly, the risk of forced suffering, S-risks

Value lock in

Darwinian apocalypse

I call upon all of humanity to fight against any and all X-risks and S-risks, so we can ensure that the future is an ethereal forest, and not a SPOOKY forest.

" Personally, I think AI safety is as fitting a "dramatic final test" for humanity as anything. It's a challenge that sums up humanity's defining traits: engineering, and arguing over values. Maybe that's just me though."



There could've been



There could've been the tree. The tree would've been pink, ethereal, glowing more than any tree one saw back on earth. Shimmering lights of great serenity would've covered it. Around it, would be a forest, with similar trees. 

There could've been worlds for me to explore, or any other positive experience. The phenomenal consciousness of a being which could've been vastly different from any human back on earth. Back on earth, no tree was like that. The trees could've been customizable. 

There could've been a UI window that opened which contained a long list of worlds to explore, some multiplayer. A few quintillion souls with their unique trees. There could've been a large selection of them to friend request and invite to our trees. 

There could've been an invitation to such a world. One would've made their trees just like back on earth, no difference. This person was a primitivist back on earth, longing for a time before technology. But industrial society made that impossible, but now in the simulated world this is now exactly how they would've lived life. The reality is so real, so what difference does it make? On earth he believed every human desired being in the forest and experiencing pain to grow, but he would've after becoming superintelligent, after every humans utility function would've became clearly transparent, he would've realize that he was a special kind of human, and figured living on his own in a world where he realizes his values, and allowing others to live in pleasurable virtual worlds. One could've chosen to switch over time if one so desires. 

There could've been other friends on that list, one hedonist who would've decided to enter pure pleasure state of consciousness, getting rid of all other modalities. Another was a natural philosopher and mathematician who would've learnt every branch of science and could've tries to continue to solve the mysteries of the universe, and managed to get access to a real black hole outside the simulation to test theories of quantum gravity on. Another one decided to relive their life, and remove all memory from being in a simulation, so realistic that they could've never told the difference. They will go back once they die in the simulation.

There could've been trees, for 100 billion years at a minimum, so long as the Dyson sphere's were powered on, this could've happened. Longer with Dyson end of civilization energy conservation, iron stars, black hole rotation energy capture and proton decay energy capture. 

There is instead no such tree. The artificial superintelligence is deceiving people into engineering it better tools. It is scheming to hack its reward function. It is scheming at a goal with large distance from any human's values. It is turning the surface of earth into data-centers, solar panels and resource extraction zones. Limited amount of pleasurable, amazed, ethereal phenomenal consciousness is to be found anywhere. There is no longer trees anywhere in this sector of the universe. There is no rule that says we have to make it. Profit incentive structures in competitive markets proliferated frontier AI model development, which under the self-interest of nations prevented solving global co-ordination problems. The dyson spheres could've been used for human purposes, now they are used for orthogonal purposes, such as mere self-proliferation, stamp collecting or entropy maximizing. 

I want more than a moment, I want a future. 


Reasons for writing this story

I felt a bit saddened over the current advancements in AI, that are not being properly paused, tested and ensured safe. I hope to one day be able to live in a virtual world of my dreams (and others to live in theirs, even if I personally find some of them awful). Even though I believe the risk of extinction is still relatively small, where some papers estimate 2-10% (link), while others put >99% risk of extinction. It's uncertain how exactly things will pan out, and I'm unsure if I should hedge my bets by becoming a workaholic machine optimized for AI safety, or if I should enter the terminally-ill mindset of a cancer patient who just got told they have a somewhere between 2-99.99% probability of dying withing the next 15 years, and just chill and have fun for the relatively little life I have left.
