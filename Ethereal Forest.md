The best VR experience I had was walking in this circular shaped park. Music was playing, some kind of ethereal music, probably lo-fi hi-hop which was popular at the time. It was very bright, the surrounding area and the trees in the middle where a combination of autumn leaves and cherry blossoms, giving this bright orange-yellow-pink color over the entire map. There were some statues near spawn, and when you went down the path further were a log cabin. Inside of it were a TV to connect to the internet and there were pillows and a fireplace. It was one of the most serene, ethereal and beautiful experiences I've had. 

This is how I imagine the far future the most. Not with Dyson spheres, matryoshka brains or intergalactic empires. Now don't get me wrong, Dyson spheres will be needed to run these simulations on large scales. But being a post-human inside of such a simulation one would never notice such structures. 

What I desperately want to avoid is the following: Extinctions, Forcing values, forced suffering, and a Darwinian apocalypse. 

First, the risk of extinction, or X-risks as they're sometimes called.

Secondly, the risk of forced suffering, S-risks

Value lock in

Darwinian apocalypse

I call upon all of humanity to fight against any and all X-risks and S-risks, so we can ensure that the future is an ethereal forest, and not a SPOOKY forest.
