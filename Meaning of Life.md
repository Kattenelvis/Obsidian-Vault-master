Sartre was right, you can make your own meaning of life. I think I have a decent approximation of the meaning of life: 

Satisficing* expected utility** under the restrictions of moderate risk aversion*** and bounded rationality****

It is also objective in the Kantian sense of rational (belief) agents presented with the same information as I have been would accept this.

*

**

\**** Bounded because of multiple reasons. Look up Pasadena game vs Altadena game (expected utility for those games doesn't exist yet Altadena game strongly dominates Pasadena game) and St Petersburg game vs Petrograd game (expected utility for those games is infinity yet Petrograd game strongly dominates St Petersburg game) . Also the bliss value in Ramsey's intergenerational welfare economics. Seems like the integral doesn't exist anymore.

*** Because I'm a wuzz. Also risk aversion taken to its extreme is no good, since it postulates that it is irrational for agents to pick any choice which has even the teeny-tiniest chance of death.
