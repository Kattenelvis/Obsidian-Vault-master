Exercise 3.1

Player 1 should pick A if 2 picks A, and B if 2 picks B.
Player 2 should pick A if 1 picks A, and B if 2 picks B

So we have 2 Nash equilibrium points, AA and BB




Exercise 3.2


we assume all players are rational.

The strategy set for $P3$ will be the following:
For the path $La$, $P3$ chooses $r$
For $Lb$, then $P3$ chooses $l$
For $R$, $P3$ chooses $r$


Shrunken game by one induction step:

![[BackwardInductionStep1.excalidraw]]

$P2$ will choose a, so the decision tree collapses too the following:

![[BackwardsInductionStep2.excalidraw]]

$P1$ will choose $L$, hence securing the nash equilibrium of $(5,4,4)$




Other equilibria 

Rbr

The non-credible threat that P2 holds over P1 leads to there.
