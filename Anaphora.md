Expressions whose reference is carried over into references later in the sentence or other sentences. For example, "John forgot his keys", where the antecedent "John" bounds to the expression "his". This is called a pronoun-anaphora. There are other examples such as modal anaphoras, sentence anaphoras e.t.c. 

Or bounded quantifiers such as 
"(12) Every male skier loves his mother."

This one is problematic:
"(14) Few professors came to the party. They had a good time."

Because it's logical form 

"(14a) Few professors : x (x came to the party and x had a good time)"

In this case, the truth satisfaction conditions are different from (14). In the first, only a few came and they all had a good time. In the second, a few professors of the many people who came had a good time. 

Idea: What about this logical form:
(14b) $\exists x (Pr(x)\wedge Pa(x)) \rightarrow Gt(x)$ 



"As its name suggests, Discourse Representation Theory was designed to capture the way in which certain features of a discourse, particularly inter-sentential relations such as inter-sentential anaphora, affect the interpretation of sentences in the discourse. At the same time, Discourse Representation Theory as originally formulated in Kamp (1981) failed to be compositional, at least in the sense of that term familiar from Montagovian approaches.[[15](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaphora/notes.html#note-15)]"

## Descriptive approaches 

Descriptive approaches instead take anaphoric pronouns to be stand-ins for definite descriptions. So for instance "John brought the horse. Matt vaccinates it" then the "it" is a stand in for "the horse that John brought".

  
$[\text{The } x:Fx](Gx) \text{ is true iff } |F|=1 \text{ and } |F-G|=0$


But the numberless descriptions, which work more like universal quantifiers, are as follows

$[\text{The } x:Fx](Gx) \text{ is true iff } |F|\geq 1 \text{ and } |F-G|=0$

So sometimes it is not definite descriptions that are the stand in for anaphoric pronouns but sometimes numberless descriptions instead.
