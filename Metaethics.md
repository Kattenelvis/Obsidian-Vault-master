Idea: Virtue Ethics and Deontology are also mathematical maximisation theories. They maximise for different goals (instead of happiness like with utilitarianism, the goal is to maximise virtues or rule following).


Ethical Supervenience:
> **Global**  
	Every pair of possible worlds that has exactly the same world-wide pattern of distribution of base properties, also has exactly the same world-wide pattern of distribution of ethical properties (cf. the entry on [supervenience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/)).

> **Weak**  
> Necessarily, if anything _x_ has some ethical property _F_, then there is at least one base property _G_ such that _x_ has _G_, and everything that has _G_ has _F_ (cf. the entry on [supervenience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/)).

The ethical properties _strongly_ supervene on the base properties just in case:

> **Strong**  
> Necessarily, if anything _x_ has some ethical property _F_, then there is at least one base property _G_ such _x_ has _G_, and **necessarily** everything that has _G_ has _F_ (cf. the entry on [supervenience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/)).


Strong implies weak, does global imply strong?
