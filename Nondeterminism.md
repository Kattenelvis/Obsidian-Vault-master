Objective probability over world states.

World state at $t$ is $w_t$. There's a set of possible worlds $w_{t,1},\dots w_{t,n}$ with a probability distribution $P$ over them. Selects the world at $t+1$. 

Alternatively, use Leibnizian branching time temporal logic. Then if say, $10$ worlds split at time $t$, and if 9 ends up being worlds where $p$ is true but 1 where $p$ is false, then there's a 90% probability that any being, now split, will continue in a $p-$world.
