One def: Necessary universal propositions.
$\square \forall x.P(x)\rightarrow Q(x)$

Idea: No need for them to be necessary, not all possible (nor even accessible) worlds need to follow the laws of nature of the actual world. Instead have them be forever, formalised in temporal logic:

$X \forall x.P(x)\rightarrow Q(x)$
Where $Xp \leftrightarrow (Hp\wedge p\wedge Fp)$

Idea: Necessetarian = Anti-Humean and Regularist = Humean


Humean vs Anti-Humean:

"[/u/topoi](https://www.reddit.com/u/topoi/)'s answer is great. I wanted to add an illustrative example that I've found helpful. (I run some risk of overgeneralizing, since I haven't studied this issue in much depth.)

Consider two different universes. Both universes just consist of a particle that moves in a straight line at a certain speed for all eternity. In one universe, the laws of physics just say that whatever particles there are move in that direction, at that speed, for all eternity (and it happens that there is just one particle). In the other universe, the laws are Newton's laws (and it happens that there is just one particle, which happens to be moving in a particular direction).

Humeans will think that what I've just said is a load of nonsense. According to Humeans, as [/u/topoi](https://www.reddit.com/u/topoi/) says, laws are the laws because they do the best job of summarizing particular matters of fact (like the locations of particles at particular times). If two universes have the same particular matters of fact, then, say the Humeans, they must have the same laws, since the best summary of the particular matters of fact in one world must be the best summary of the (identical) particular matters of fact in the other world. In technical terms, Humeans hold to what is called a _supervenience_ thesis. They think that the laws cannot be different unless the particular matters of fact are different, or that the laws "supervene on" the particular matters of fact.

Anti-Humeans, on the other hand, think that two universes could indeed differ in the way that I've described. They think that, beyond the particular matters of fact, laws are things that make the particular matters of fact go the way they do. So it's perfectly sensible to think of one set of laws that just make everything go in a particular direction and a different set of laws that make things behave according to inertia and gravity and the like, even if there aren't enough particles for those differences to manifest themselves in the particular matters of fact.

Thinking about laws is closely aligned with thinking about counterfactuals (statements of the form "If X were the case, then Y would be the case"). Anti-Humeans would think that "If there were two particles, they would both travel in the same direction forever" is right to say about the first universe, while "If there were two particles, they would be gravitationally attracted to each other" is right to say about the second universe. Humeans, since they don't think the laws can differ in this way at all, also wouldn't accept that the counterfactuals could differ."
