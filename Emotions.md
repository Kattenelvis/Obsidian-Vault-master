Necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be an emotion:
1. The phenomenology, the feeling
2. Intentionality, aboutness
3. Cognition

Idea: Emotion is actually a tuple $\{E,A\}$ the phenomenal experience $E$ and the propositional attitude $A$. $E$ is a set and $A$ is a set of propositions in some language $L$.   

$A = Lc$ 
$E=\{s\subset\P|s\in\}$ 


There are for instance 
1. positive and negative emotions
2. conscious and unconscious emotions, 
3. reflexive and non-reflexive emotions.


some theories claim emotions are reducible to admixtures of beliefs and desires.

James-Lange theory: Emotions are physiological processess/bodily states

Some cultures don't distinguish anger and sadness.

Some emotions are associated with many bodily processess (romantic love)

Emotions might be intentional. "angry about p" "sad about p".
But bodily processess might not be intentional "a pain", "an itch", "a racing heart".


Cognitive Theories:

emotion preceeds bodily processess (emotions causes bodily processess)

Contemporary definitions of emotions differ on whether emotions, in essence, are feelings, judgements, quasi-perceptual states, certain physiological responses, a mixture of these elements etc. See Deonna and Teroni (2012) for an overview.



Idea: On the Arousal-Velence model, there are feedback loops whenever two people are on similar parts of the model where their emotions, unless hampered by some process, will continuously increase in arousal and/or valence. This is especially prevalent with anger. 

Idea: Emotions in general can be a point in the coordinate grid of the AV model and also sometimes accompanied with a thought. One such example is existential anxiety, which could be at say 0.3 valence 0.6 arousal.

"We will note that emotions have historically been conceptualized in one of three main ways: as experiences, as evaluations, and as motivations. Each of these research traditions captures something true and significant about the emotions, but no theory within any tradition appears immune from counterexamples and problem cases. Concerning the rationality of emotions, we will distinguish two main varieties of it—cognitive rationality and strategic rationality—and explore a number of ways in which the emotions can succeed or fail with respect to different standards of rationality."

"Two broad desiderata have governed the project of defining emotions in both philosophy and affective science: (a) Achieving compatibility with ordinary linguistic usage, and (b) Achieving theoretical fruitfulness. A definition that aims exclusively at (a) is a _descriptive_ definition. A definition that aims at (b) at the cost of possibly violating some ordinary intuitions is _prescriptive_. To secure ordinary language compatibility, traditional philosophers have relied on introspection, thought experiments, casual observation, gleaning of insights from literary texts and other artistic sources, and more recently, experimental tests of ordinary intuitions and of the psychological processes underlying them performed within “experimental philosophy”."

"This multi-dimensional heterogeneity has led some to conclude that folk emotion categories do not designate natural kinds, either with respect to the generic category of emotion (Rorty 1980b, 2003; Griffiths 1997; Russell 2003; Zachar 2006; Kagan 2007, 2010) or with respect to specific emotion categories such as anger, fear, happiness, disgust, and so on (Scarantino 2012; Barrett 2006, 2017). Others have argued that there is, nevertheless, enough homogeneity among instances of folk emotion categories to allow them to qualify as natural kinds (e.g., Charland 2002; Prinz 2004; Zinck & Newen 2008)."
