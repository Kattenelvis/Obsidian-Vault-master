Copenhagen:
No to determinism
No to hidden variables
No to realism

"A lack of a kind of [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism "Philosophical realism") (understood here as asserting independent existence and evolution of physical quantities, such as position or momentum, without the process of measurement) is crucial in the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation "Copenhagen interpretation"). Realistic interpretations (which were already incorporated, to an extent, into the physics of Feynman[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory#cite_note-7)), on the other hand, assume that particles have certain trajectories. Under such view, these trajectories will [almost always](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all "Almost all") be continuous, which follows both from the finitude of the perceived speed of light ("leaps" should rather be precluded) and, more importantly, from the principle of least action, as [deduced in quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation#Quantum_action_principle "Path integral formulation") by Dirac. But continuous movement, in accordance with the [mathematical definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function#Definition_in_terms_of_limits_of_functions "Continuous function"), implies deterministic movement for a range of time arguments;[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory#cite_note-8) and thus realism is, under modern physics, one more reason for seeking (at least certain limited) determinism and thus a hidden-variable theory (especially that such theory exists: see [De Broglie–Bohm interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory "De Broglie–Bohm theory"))."

Idea: Given true probability and discrete time, what happends when say the decided spin of an electron is measured at the same time? Do they compute at the same time? If so, there's 4 possibilities from $t$ to $t+1$.
