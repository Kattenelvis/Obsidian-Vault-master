Also, being unapologetically autistic is my normal way of being :trollface:. I will be using the SEP page on this topic as a source https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects

There are multiple ways of characterizing abstract objects. They are normally contrasted with concrete objects:
x is an abstract object if and only if x is not a concrete object. 

And one way of characterizing abstract objects is to give a list of properties they don't have (section 3.5):

x is an abstract object if and only if it is non-mental and non-sensible
x is an abstract object if and only if x is non-spatial (doesn't take up any space)
x is an abstract object if and only if x is non-causal (has no causal powers)
x is an abstract object if and only if it is non-temporal 
e.t.c

The development of the distinction came from Frege, who wanted to distinguish concrete objects such as mental objects and physical objects, from abstract objects such as mathematical objects. In this way, the objectivity and aprioricity of mathematics could be retained (Section 2.1). It's a rejection of dualism in favour of trialism. 

Frege did not use the above characterization, but instead used the following (section 3.4):

Abstract objects are the referents of functional predicates f such that for expression f(a), then f(a)=f(b) if and only if Rab where R is an equivalence relation. 

Examples include say, shape of house A and shape of house B. The shapes are abstract objects because if the shapes are identical, then there's an equivalence. In contrast to concrete objects such as "The father of a" and "The father of b" since there is no equivalence relation between a and b. The function f must be an abstraction principle according to this characterization. 

Platonism is defined as the viewpoint that abstract objects exists. Nominalism is the defined to be the viewpoint that abstract objects do not exist. At the very least, they don't have existence beyond the mental or physical. 

Now to characterize mental objects (Section 3.5.1):
"One promising approach is to say that an object should be reckoned mind-dependent (which the article states is the same word for mental object) when, by its very nature, it exists _at a time_ if and only if it is the object or content of some mental state or process _at that time_."

The article goes over some problems and comes up with a second one:
"A more generous conception would allow for mind-dependent objects that exist at a time in virtue of mental activity at that time, even if the object is not the object of any single mental state or act. The fusion of X’s afterimage and Y’s headache is mind-dependent in the second sense but not the first. That is a reason to prefer the second account of mind-dependence."

And now what can be argued for, and what nominalists argue for, is that abstract objects are mind-dependent. Given the second characterization of mental objects, this gives a reason to believe that abstract objects might be mind-dependent:

"If we understand the notion of mind-dependence in this way, it is a mistake to insist that abstract objects be mind-independent. To strike a theme that will recur, it is widely supposed that sets and classes are abstract entities—even the _impure_ sets whose urelements are concrete objects. Any account of the abstract/concrete distinction that places set-theoretic constructions like {Alfred,{Betty,{Charlie,Deborah}}}{Alfred,{Betty,{Charlie,Deborah}}} on the concrete side of the line will be seriously at odds with standard usage. With this in mind, consider the set whose sole members are X’s afterimage and Y’s headache, or some more complex set-theoretic object based on these items. If we suppose, as is plausible, that an impure set exists at a time only when its members exist at that time, this will be a mind-dependent entity in the generous sense. But it is also presumably an abstract entity."

Which can be argued for better than denying the existence of mental objects which begun this whole discussion. Again, denying mental objects is absolutely ridiculous, but abstract objects might be a subset of mental objects if nominalism is true. 

1. Mental objects have causal powers, and are temporal (might be spatial). For example, a series of mental events is a mental process, and the mental events generally have causal powers over one another. For example, associationist structures of thought [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/associationist-thought/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/associationist-thought/ "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/associationist-thought/") Section 1,2 and 4

    The stimulus of ringing of the bell causes salivation in the famous exeperiment by Pavlov. The mental object "ringing bell stimulus" causes salivation. But the thought of a word could cause the thought of another word and so on
