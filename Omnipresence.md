Augustine and Anselm have highly problematic views on omnipresence that is straight up contradictory. Aquinas makes a better case:

God is present at a place just in case there is a physical object that is at that place and God has power over that object, knows what is going on in that object, and God is the cause of that object’s existence

Everitt (2010) Says: “if this is how omnipresence is interpreted, one might well think that it would be clearer to say straightforwardly that God is not omnipresent at all,”
