8.1


Semantic externalism, skepticism


S5 axiom $Kp\rightarrow KKp$ is false in non-skeptical scenarios (epistemic externalism?)


If evidence is knowledge then why would evidence have properties?
Is evidence an object, proposition or modal operator? 
Object whenever it has properties
Proposition whenever it is a probability
Operator whenever its identical to knowledge


2 main arguments, the first demonstrates using axiom (1) that there's no evidence property difference between different cases (good cases and bad cases)

The second one seems to use a sorites paradox to establish that (1) leads to an absurd conclusion.



"The standard conception of rationality depends on a distinction between the aims and methods of cognitive activity. On that conception, truth is an aim. We cannot attain it directly; we cannot follow the rule 'Believe truly!' when we do not know what is true. Therefore we must use methods to reach the truth. Rationality is a method. We can follow rules of rationality because we are always in a position to know what they require. **If the argument of section 8.6 is correct, this picture of rationality is mistaken**. Just as one cannot always know what one's evidence is, so one cannot always know what rationality requires of one. Just like evidence, the requirements of rationality can differ between indiscriminable situations. Rationality may be a matter of doing the best one can with what one has, but one cannot always know what one has, or whether one has done the best one can with it."



"There is a pragmatist and subjective Bayesian project to operationalize epistemology by working only with concepts whose application is always accessible to the agent. The argument of this chapter implies that the project is doomed to failure." 

WHAT! Also ig that would be an internalist conception of justification?

"Uncertainty about evidence does not generate an infinite regress of evidence about evidence about . . . . In order to reflect adequately on one's evidence, one might need evidence about one's evidence, and in order to reflect adequately about the latter evidence, one might need evidence about it, and so on. But this regress is merely and harmlessly potential. We cannot in fact realize infinitely many levels of adequate reflection; at best, further reflection enables us to realize finitely many further stages. At some stage one must rely on unreflective causal sensitivity to evidence (see section 9.3 )."



"One's cognitive circumstances may be so bad that one is in no position to know how impoverished one's evidence is in comparison to the good case."



"It has not been shown that the good and bad cases do differ in evidence. That requires a positive account of evidence, which Chapters 9 and 10 will develop. They defend the view that one's total evidence (not one's evidence for p alone) is simply one's total knowledge, on which the assumption that one has the same total evidence in the two cases is tantamount to the sceptic's conclusion. For since, uncontroversially, in the bad case one fails to know p, p would not be part of one's total evidence in the bad case, and would therefore not be part of one's total evidence in the good case either; so in the good case, too, one would not know p. A sceptic who assumes that one's total evidence is the same begs the question against a non-sceptic who takes that view of evidence."


"One's rationality depends on the rules which one uses rather than the processes which go on in one. One is typically not in a position to know what process caused one's belief, but we are tempted end p.182 to suppose that one is always in a position to know what rules one used in reaching it. For if one was not in a position to know what rules one was using, and one's rationality depended on the rationality of one's rules, how could one be required to be rational? The requirement that one is always in a position to know what rules one is using forces us into individuating them phenomenally, just as the corresponding epistemic requirement on evidence forced us into individuating it phenomenally. If a rule were individuated non-phenomenally, one could to all appearances be using it while not in fact be doing so; in which case one would not be in a position to know that one was not using that rule. An argument similar to (1)-(12) concludes that one is using the same rule in the good and bad cases. According to the sceptic, what matters for knowledge is the reliability of the rule, not of the process, so one's false belief in the bad case makes one's rule in the good case unreliable, and therefore undermines knowledge in the good case."




"The sceptic's conception of a rule collapses. By an argument parallel to (1)-(13) (via (2 i ) (12 i )), only trivial rules meet the epistemic requirement. For a series of indiscriminable differences links a case in which one uses a given rule to a case in which one uses a quite different rule. For example, one initially believes p for reason R while giving no weight to reason R*; gradually one gives less weight to R and more to R*, until finally one believes p for reason R* while giving no weight to R. R and R* differ so much in kind that believing for reason R and believing for reason R* amount to using different rules. An argument just like that of section 8.6 refutes the assumption that in every case one is in a position to know what rule one is using. Even when the sceptic does not assume identity of evidence between the good and bad cases, the underlying dialectic is the same."



Possible rules and causal processes of belief causation. Being knowledgable of the latter and not the former? Williamson says no. 




Knowledge = Evidence

"As usual, 'knowledge' is understood as propositional knowledge. The communal case is needed: science depends on public evidence, which is neither the union nor the intersection of the evidence of each scientist."


Knowledge comes prior, and Justification and evidence is defined/explained in terms of knowledge



"EV e is evidence for h for S if and only if S's evidence includes e and P(h| e) > P(h). One consequence of EV is that e is evidence for h only if e is evidence for itself. For if P(h| e) > P(h), then P(e) is neither 0 (otherwise P(h| e) is ill defined) nor 1 (otherwise P(h| e) = P(h)). Hence P(e| e) is well defined with the value 1, which is greater than P(e), so e is evidence for e, by EV with 'e' substituted for 'h'. But is it not circular for anything to be evidence for itself? A critic might therefore argue that one's evidence does not consist of a fixed body of propositions; either it depends on the hypothesis under assessment, where no proposition belongs to the evidence relative to its own assessment, or it does not consist of propositions."


Probability of evidence given evidence?


"Carnap calls the requirement of total evidence: [I]n the application of inductive logic to a given knowledge situation, the total evidence available must be taken as a basis for determining the degree of confirmation. (1950 : 211; compare Hempel 1965 : 63-7) If too much or too little is counted as evidence, inductive principles will be misapplied. Given the requirement of total evidence, disputes between different theories of evidence are not merely verbal; they involve disagreements as to which inductive conclusions are warranted."


Sizes of sets of evidence matters then I suppose

"hether one's evidence includes any given item, and that an adequate theory of evidence must explain how it manages to be so unproblematic. By the argument of Chapter 8, however, no correct theory of evidence can have that upshot. Certainly the equation E = K does not, but since that does not distinguish it from other theories of evidence, it constitutes no objection to E = K. In obvious symbolism, E = K equates E p and K p. The transparency of evidence would make E p equivalent to KE p. Given E = K, that is tantamount to making K p equivalent to KK p. But we saw in section 5.1 that K p does not entail KK p. This section explores our limited access to our evidence in the light of the equation E= K."


Argument from best explanation P(H|E) > P(H*|E)



"If perceptual evidence consists of propositions, which propositions are they? Consider an example. I am trying to identify a mountain by its shape. I can see that it is pointed; that it is pointed may be part of my evidence for believing that it is not Ben Nevis. However, the proposition that it is pointed does not begin to exhaust my present perceptual evidence. No description of the mountain in words seems to capture the richness of my visual experience of its irregular shape. But it does not follow that my evidence is non-propositional. If I want to convey my"

NOPE It can all be captured by propositions



"If I want to convey my end p.197 evidence, I might point and say 'It is that shape'.8 Of course, the mere linguistic meaning of the sentence type 'It is that shape' does not convey my evidence, for it is independent of the reference of 'that shape' in a particular context of utterance. Only by using the sentence in an appropriate context do I express the proposition at issue."

so "that" in "that shape" is context dependent/has context dependent reference?


Seeing black and red balls with replacement. I may not have evidence of the ball at n+1 after seeing n balls, even though I have justified true belief that, given that every previous ball was red, that the next one will be red. No evidence means no knowledge. JTB but not knowledge?


Evidence is knowledge, evidence is true.

Is evidence unquestionable? Sets dogmatic priors on evidence![[Pasted image 20240805140956.png]]



". Now I do want to emphasize that there are other ways of defining epistemic possibility. One could say that P is epistemically possible for S if P is consistent with the totality of S's evidence for believing P. And on some conceptions of evidence, P might be consistent with S's evidence for believing P even if it is inconsistent with everything that S kno"

Well williamson says knowledge is evidence so the last one would be inconsistent.
