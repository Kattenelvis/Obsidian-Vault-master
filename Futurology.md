1.  I have a good idea of a general spread of possibilities in longterm trends. The possibilities are something like this: 

- Everything goes in the direction it currently goes to without major calamities or meta-paradigm-shifts (frankly neither Corona nor Ukraine are major deviations). This _almost definitely_ implies serious loss of a nation-state's importance due to objective factors of globalization. 
- Superintellegent AI is invented and achieves fast takeoff; probably we either all die quick deaths or radically change as society. 
- Slow takeoff of superintellegence, not only from NNs or brain emulation but possibly through designer kids and such. Probably just accelerates normal tendencies except default humans lose relevance over time. 
- We fail to transition to longer-term uranium generators before running out of fossil fuels or inventing fusion power. This can cause a serious regress or even collapse with a painfully slow rebuilding time. 
- General systemic collapse happens for reasons unrelated to technology. This have in fact happened in Bronze Age. Hard to predict or gauge impact. Seems likelier given social media. 
- Nuclear war by impressively spiteful leaders or a pandemic bioengineered by a collective of people both very smart and very devoted to total obliteration seriously set civilization back. The latter one might literally kill everyone. But a nuclear war wouldn't, afaik, not even with a pessimistic nuclear winter. Rebuilding would probably be fast-ish. 
- We invent fusion power. This will just boost economy into overdrive and accelerate normal processes. 
- We achieve proper nanotechnology. It's really hard to say what's possible with that, but molds, viruses, and algae give a vivid low estimate. Hard to gauge impact. 
- We master bioengineering. That probably kills us all. 
- We master some black swan tech or encounter a black swan event. Meet aliens, for example.
    
    
    Relative probabilities, I have a very limited idea about.




Starlifting: Instead of building dyson sphere's, dismantle stars and build fusion reactors

Better yet: Integrate fusion reactors into computers running virtual minds. The computer can be partially composed of hydrogen-helium and will be dismantled over time.
