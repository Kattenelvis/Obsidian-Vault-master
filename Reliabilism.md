Goldman 1979 the reliabilist revolution

He claims that one cannot define justification in the way with epistemic terms, only (purely) doxastic, modal, metaphysical, semantic or syntatctic terms. 

He claims that it's not enough to have sufficient conditions such as "if S sense redness at t and S believes they sense redness at t then S is justified in the belief" since this doens't explicate the definition. It leaves unexaplained why a person believes something. 

He leaves out cases of people knowing about ones justification about a belief. 

Idea: What if reliabilism is true and someone has knowledge of reliable processess and believes with some probability that reliable process X generates true beliefs with highest reliability. Is this person "more justified" than someone who does not know about reliable processes?

Goldman specified theories by their satisfaction of the J-schema $\lceil$$S$'s belief in $p$ at time $t$ is justified$\rceil$, that is to say, the conditions that satisfy the J-schema in all cases. Inductive definition of such theories would be convenient. 

Goldman then goes over several base clauses for such an inductive theory and sees that many of them fail.

Eventually number (5) is proposed as the best base clause. 

'$S$ is justified in $p$ only if $p$ is formed by a reliable process at time $t$'

A reasoning process that is reliable generates often true beliefs given true premisses and a reliable memory process is one that retains true propositions. 

The reason for having 't' in all of the definitions is what Nozick calls "Current time slice" theories. This is so the cognizer is justified in a belief at the time of reasoning to that belief. A belief can have many ancestral trees of reasoning and atleast one has to be reliable.  

Idea: Given a belief formed at time t, is it realiable to be used as a premise in a logical justification at t + k? Perhaps using more recently reasoned beliefs is more reliable?


Here are some examples of processes that frequently lead to false beliefs: 
Wishful thinking 
Reliance on emotional attachment
Mere hunch or guesswork
Hasty generalization

Here are some examples of processes that frequently lead to True beliefs:
Standard perceptual processes
Valid reasoning
Introspection

Idea: Constructing theories with verifiable/falsifiable statements with the different methods would allow one to verify how reliable the processes are. By the verification theory of meaning, the statement that "Process X is reliable" is thus meaningful (and can thus be true or false). 

Apparently that idea has already been done, it's called "approved list reliablilism". 

"Jack Lyons (2009, 2011) who argues that in order for a non-inferential belief to be justified, it must be the result of a “primal system”. Drawing on research in cognitive science, Lyons proposes that a primal system is any cognitive system that meets two conditions: (i) it is “inferentially opaque”—that is, its outputs are not the result of an introspectively accessible train of reasoning, (ii) it develops as a result of a combination of learning and innate constraints"

'Suppose we inhabit the actual world (@), and we’re evaluating a subject _S_ who inhabits some other world wsws. Then there are two different things we could mean when we say that _S_’s belief-forming process is reliable: we could mean that it’s reliable relative to @, or we could mean that it’s reliable relative to wsws (Sosa 1993, 2001). Comesaña (2002) uses this distinction to provide a solution to the new evil demon problem cast in the framework of two-dimensional semantics (Stalnaker 1999). On Comesaña’s proposal, the sentence, “_S_ is justified in believing _p_” has two readings: (i) that _S_’s belief-forming process is reliable relative to @, (ii) that _S_’s belief-forming process is reliable relative to wsws. If wsws is a demon world, then reading (i) will be true, but reading (ii) is false. While Comesaña’s use of two-dimensional semantics has drawn criticism (Ball & Blome-Tillman 2013), the basic strategy of solving the New Evil Demon problem by appealing to two types of reliability remains popular'


Mind/Brain identity theory: A causal belief formation process can be tokenized, and can then be typized. Different types have different reliabaility, such as the causal belief formation process of the belief "There is a maple tree outside" is the token and the types "vision", more coarse grained "perception" or more fine grained "visual experience of a maple tree on a sunny afternoon". The generality problem is then the question on which type to pick for any token.

Solutions:
Psychological: 
"Let _A_ be the broadest such type. Choose a partition that is the broadest objectively homogeneous subclass of _A_ within which the token process falls, where a class is objectively homogeneous if no statistically relevant partition of it can be effected"
