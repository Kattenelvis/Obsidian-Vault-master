(1) Jon Roffe's [T_he Works of Gilles Deleuze, Vol. 1_](https://re-press.org/books/the-works-of-gilles-deleuze-i-1953-1969/)_,_ which is available for free!

(2) Daniel Smith's _Essays on Deleuze_. Indispensable.

(3) Levi Bryant's _Difference and Givenness._ An oldie, but one of the best.

Bonus: (4) Manuel Delanda's _Virtual Philosophy and Intensive Science,_ which brings Deleuze in conversation with the sciences of complexity and is just an amazing read.

But there's no substituting for reading the works themselves.
