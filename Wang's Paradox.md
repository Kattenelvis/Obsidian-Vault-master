List of assumptions to conclusions?

1. Constructive mathematics?
2. Strict finitism is coherent only if the notion of totalities of this sort is itself coherent. My remarks will bear on strict finitism only at this point.
3. 0 is small; If n is small, n + 1 is small: Therefore, every number is small.(more of an argument with 2 premises)
4. Small is vague (might be a conclusion of 3)
5. Modus ponens work (in cases where the above argument fails)
6. Efter att ha visat att Wang's paradox inte nödvändigtvist är motsägelsefult för ultrafinitisten om man tolkar "naturliga tal" och "litet" på rätt sätt. "It thus seems that we have no recourse but to turn back to the alter- native we set aside at the very outset, namely that the second premiss of the induction, the induction step, is not after all true."
7. It seems absurd that n small and n+1 not small.
8. A satisfactory account of vague- ness ought to explain two contrary feelings we have: that expressed by Frege that the presence of vague expressions in a language invests it with an intrinsic incoherence; and the opposite point of view contended for by Wittgenstein, that vagueness is an essential feature of language.


> t is difficult to see how to prove it, but it seems plausible that, for any vague predicate 'P', and any name 'a' of an object of which 'P' is neither definitely true nor definitely false, we can find a predicate 'Q', incompatible 310 MICHAEL DUMMETT with 'P', such that the statement 'a is either P or Q' is definitely true, and hence the statement 'a is either P or not P' is definitely true also. And thus it appears plausible, more generally, that, for any vague statement 'A', the law of excluded middle 'A or not A' must be admitted as correct, even though neither 'A' nor 'Not A' may be definitely true.
