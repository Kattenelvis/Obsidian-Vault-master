"As I shall reconstruct the traditional interpretation it begins with two premises derived from Wittgensteinian philosophy of language in general and is followed by a third relating only to private objects. It is this last which bears the main burden of the argument. 

1 The meaning of a word is given by the rule which governs its use. 

2 A rule must be such that there is a difference between following it correctly and not following it correctly. 

3 If a word purports to name a logically private object then there is no difference between following the corresponding rule correctly and not following it correctly. Therefore (from (2) and (3)) 

4 If a word purports to name a logically private object it does not follow a genuine rule. Therefore (from (1) and (4)) 

5 If a word purports to name a logically private object then it lacks meaning."
