    1. There is no evidence of any cult like behavior. Maybe I've just missed this evidence, in which case, providing it would be nice (actual examples, or a general sociological study delving into the LW community).
    2. Cults as a familiar resemblence would include things like Heaven's gate, Jehovah's witnesses and Scientology. Looking into those cults, we often see that members are encouraged to completely cut people not in the cult out in their lives. This is not the case for LW, where I have seen upvoted articles advocating for various friendship strategies, which do not involve 100% commitment to other LW people.
    3. Cults encourage users to donate or benefit the cult. Jehovah's witnesses are expected to pay as much as they possibly can. LW don't really do this. Often they mention other organizations, such as effective altruism etc. to join in addition to it. In this way, LW is not the only thing they're encouraged to be in.
    4. Jehovah's Witnesses are typically extremely discouraged from any contact outside the cult, including forcing them to take jobs such as janitors etc. where they don't speak with others. Again, not the case for LW. The 80000 hours podcast, a related job suggestion board, does not force members to pick careers that optimises for LW or anything like that, often taken individual concerns and preferences into consideration.

    5. Yudkowski would probably be flattered to be said to be as charismatic as a cult leader. His charisma is not so high as really seen. I've seen a couple of presentations and him on the Lex Friedman podcast. In no way is he particularly charismatic like a cult leader would be, like the one who lead heavens gate.
    6. Cults strongly discourage wrongthink and questioning authority. Questioning minor details on the Jehovah's account of the bible can get you expelled. On the LW forums, writing articles criticizing earlier articles, including those by Yudkowski, is perfectly find and is done all the time.
    7. The only evidence I've seen of LW being a cult is other people calling it a cult. I've wondered why this is the case. Some people react in kinda mysterious ways on some ideas presented by LW or adjacent, scoffing at even the thought of some things like Roko's basilisk or acausal trade. While I "disagree" with both of those examples, they are definetly worth taking just as seriously as any other philosophical idea.
    8. My hypothesis for why people call LW a cult is because it's some kind of defense mechanism or some other kind of irrationality or emotional states to avoid some of the conclusions posited, which is why the arguments or ideas aren't being taken seriously in the first place. But I don't know, this could be entirely wrong.
