Half-Idea (early chapter 2): The best hypothesis which fits with the available data is one which coheres best with the rest of one's established belief system

Best interpretation that fits with the available data when trying to understand a text, human, image, event, e.t.c. Data points in general and a hypothesis to go along with it. 

Central point of the book: Certain relations $R$ such as for example "explains" increase coherence in a set of propositions while other relations such as 'contradicts' decrease coherence in the set. Then in any set of propositions there's a maximally coherent subset of propositions. This is a computational procedure that generates two sets, the acceptance set and the rejctance set. 

Followed by a long list of examples in ethics, mathematics, science e.t.c:

Very interesting passage:
"Russell has argued that the justification of mathematical axioms is similarly a matter of coherence (Russell 1973, see also Kitcher 1983, and chapter 3). Axioms are accepted not because they are a priori true, but because they serve to generate and systematize interesting theorems, which are themselves justified in part because they follow from the axioms."

Gerry Mackie (personal communication) has suggested that deliberative democracy should not be thought of in terms of the idealization of complete consensus, but in terms of a group process of satisfying numerous positive and negative constraints. Details remain to be worked out, but democratic political decision appears to be a matter of both explanatory and deliberative coherence. Explanatory coherence is required for judgments of fact that are relevant to decisions, and multiagent deliberative coherence is required for choosing what is optimal for the group as a whole. See the end of chapter 5 for further discussion of coherence in politics."

"The dozen coherence problems summarized in table 2.1 might give the impression that the different kinds of inference involved in all the problems occur in isolation from each other. But any general theory of coherence must be able to say how different kinds of coherence can interact. For example, the problem of other minds can be understood as involving both explanatory coherence and analogical coherence: the plausibility of my hypothesis that you have a mind is based both on it being the best explanation of your behavior and on the analogy between your behavior and my behavior (chapter 4, section 4). The interconnections between different kinds of coherence can be effectively modeled by introducing new kinds of constraints between the elements of the different coherence problems. In the problem of other minds, the explanatorycoherence element representing the hypothesis that you have a mind can be connected by a positive constraint with the analogical-coherence element representing the mapping hypothesis that you are similar to me. Choosing the best explanation and the best analogy can then occur simultaneously as interconnected coherence processes. Similarly, ethical justification and epistemic justification can be intertwined through constraints that connect ethical principles and empirical beliefs, for example, about human nature (chap. 5). A full, applied coherence theory would specify the kinds of connecting constraints that interrelate the different kinds of coherence problems."
