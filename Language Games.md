Mathematical logic can describe the rules, the rules are used in certain ways, the meaning of the rules is in their use. 

Post-modernists might have taken this theory but instead taken the meanings to be determined through, instead of rules, by through power structures. 

There seem to be some empirical reasons for believing both are wrong. One is universal grammar. The idea that there is a built-in grammatical structure in the language module of human minds might posit that there is some logical structure of the world that's being captured by language. 

The meaning of connectives, negation, and modalities seem to not be about its use necessarily.
