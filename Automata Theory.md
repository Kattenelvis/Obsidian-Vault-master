Algebraic Automata theory:

"Formal languages are just subsets of the free monoid X∗ over some (usually finite and not empty) alphabet X . For any nonempty alphabet X there exist uncountably many such languages."
Unless FST bound obviously. 

"Since any monoid can be embedded into its automorphism monoid, e.g., by post-multiplication, recognition by completely deterministic finite automata can be abstracted to recognition via monoid homomorphisms with finite codomain. And just as there exists a minimal completely deterministic automaton recognizing a given regular language, there also exists a minimal monoid with this property, the so-called syntactic monoid, introduced by Schützenberger in 1956"
