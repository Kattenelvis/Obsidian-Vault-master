"Reality" is somewhat vague, so I will define it as "Concretized possible worlds". 

A possible world $W$ is commonly defined as an algebra on propositions closed under logical entailment that does not contain any contradictions. This means that if we say, have propositions $p$ and $p\rightarrow q$, then it's closure is $\{p, p\rightarrow q, q, p\wedge q\}$ since we get $q$ modus ponens. 

Worth mentioning that a proposition is what declarative sentences refer to. So for instance if I say "snow is white" then I will refer to the abstract proposition $p$ that is true if and only if snow is white. And something like $p\rightarrow q$ could be "if snow is white, then snow has a color". So using modus ponens, we get "snow has a color". We can thus describe a world as $\{$"snow is white", "if snow is white, then snow has a color", "snow has a color"$\}$.

We may now define "concretized possible world" as a world that is actualized, non-abstract object. We will take it for granted that what's usually called "the actual world", or the world that I'm in, $W_@$, is real. 

Modal realists, and possible worlds realists, take it that there can be many, indeed uncountably infinitely many concretized possible worlds. Sean Carroll for instance, a physicist who turned into a philosopher of physics, tries to establish an overarching view that incorporates both modal realism and possible worlds realism. He states that there's an uncountably infinitely many concretized possible worlds. 

Some may also include the hypothesis of many bubble universes created at the big big bang would count. However the problem is that the original theory still establishes causal connection between the bubble universes, which means they're all a part of the same concretized possible world. As such I'd argue that this theory doesn't count.

I cannot be certain on the number of concretized possible worlds. But given Occam Razor commitments, we should expect to assume as few as possible. So in the end we end up with a probability distribution that looks like this:

Zero possible worlds: $\approx 0\%$
One possible world: $\approx 85\%$
Finite number of possible world greater than one: $\approx 4\%$
Countably infinite worlds: $\approx 3\%$
Higher ordinal infinite worlds: $\approx 8\%$
