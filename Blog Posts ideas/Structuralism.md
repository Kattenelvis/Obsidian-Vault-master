Structuralist math + Structuralist physics + Structuralist realism + Russellian Monism/Panpsychism


Combination laws we need better understanding but doable in practice. 

Russellian monism implies Teletransportation is not survival because the structural properties might be "preserved", but quiddites and combination laws less so


Quiddites as fundamental. I think the final theory of the world does not contain junkyness or gunkyness because otherwise we get Skolem's paradox. Rejection of ontic structuralism
