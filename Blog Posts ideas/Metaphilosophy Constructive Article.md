# Philosophy as a set of assumptions and conclusions


All there is to it!


# Philosophy in Formal Language

Philosophical systems and principles can be described in formal languages. 


Dialogues Formalized in dialogical logic



But if all philosophy can and should be done in formal language, explain how so much philosophy seems to be successful with natural language?

The idea is that philosophy in natural language is a P-time complexity approximation algorithm. It's easier and faster. It is not proper philosophy, but an approximation of philosophy.
