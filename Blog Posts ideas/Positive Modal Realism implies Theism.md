Since Almeida does not advance a detailed version of the cosmological argument, we might attempt to reconstruct his view.

1. “Possible worlds are composite concrete objects… [that] _necessarily_ coexist” (2018: 75). This is a central contention of his Lewisian modal realism (75).
2. The pluriverse exists as “the collection of all possible worlds” (7,75).
3. Everything that exists has an absolute explanation for its existence. Strong PSR
4. “Therefore, there is an absolute explanation for the pluriverse” (75).
5. An absolute explanation is possible “only if there are no contingent facts,” that is, only if everything exists necessarily (78–79).
6. Therefore, there are no brute or contingent facts.
7. This absolute explanation is found in the fact that God necessarily exists (75,82).




Theodicity: Bad worlds? No, there are only positive worlds


Value of a world V(w)

Total goodness is maximized when you instantiate all positive worlds


What about neutral worlds i.e V(w) = 0?

Doesn't make a difference to total goodness, so unsure if they are included.
