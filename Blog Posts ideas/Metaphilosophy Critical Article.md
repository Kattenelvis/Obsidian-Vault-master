conceptual analysis, obsessive focus on language, questionable ways of employing intuitions

# Philosophy

In its highest generality, philosophy, science and mathematics is about arguments from premises to conclusions. This includes observation sentences. Philosophy, science, mathematics and other similar studies will be named "propositional derivative systems" to indicate their foundation in formal logic. 

To formalize this notion we fix a formal system $S$ for some language $L$ for which to formalise some argument in. The structure of $L$ can remain vague for now. It can be a propositional logic, a first order logic, second order, modal logic etc. $S$ can also remain vague, wether (under a propositional language) classical, intuitionistic, paraconsistent etc or however it deals with quantifiers, identity etc. 

In general, it will include formulas built up inductively from atomic formulas and grammatical rules, aswell as a set of inference rules. Some theory $T$ in $L$ holds the non-logical synthetic propositions of which an argument is formalized as. $T$ would then contain for instance, the axioms of $ZFC$ which are the premises in modern mathematics for its conclusions, $T$ may contain the postulates of quantum mechanics and observation sentences describing the experiments, and $T$ may be the list of axioms in integrated information theory and observation sentences thereby, $T$ can be Spinoza's axioms or $T$ can just be a small simple argument, for instance the cosmological argument or the no miracles argument. 

Carnap distinguishes the analytic and synthetic in a way which is not critiqued by Quine's dogmas. Whenever we have a fixed system in some language, we can take it that the tautologies are the analytic statements and anything derived from an axiom in some theory $T$ is synthetic. 

We may very well distinguish philosophy from other propositional derivational systems such as science and mathematics in that it generally lacks observation statements while also containing synthetic propositions.

Notably, by these definitions, mathematics is synthetic. Note that this might assume Hillberts thesis, the idea that mathematics is reducible to ZFC, which is usually taken for granted but may not be the case. 

Note, this is not a restriction on scientific methodology. Fully formalized science is compatible with even Feyarabendian approaches to method restrictions (i.e the empty restriction).


We thus get a natural history of philosophy as the adding of $T$'s
We also get the logical closure of $T$ as $C(T)$ which include all derivations of $T$. 

Historicism: More and more are added over time, adding to our collection of philosophies. A philosophy $T$ can be understood as adding to or negating a previous one.

Example:
Descartes:

$T=\{ \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg K(\exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$

Moorean Shift:

$T'=\{ K(\exists x Hand(x)), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg  \}$

$\{\neg K(\exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T')$



Conceptual analysis is done withing T's which would include intuition statements (which would probably be similar to observation statements in science)


Meta-languages and meta-philosophy. Avoiding circularity.


Is there an explanation for why natural language is used when I'm arguing all of philosophy (but not necessarily meta-philosophy) is formal?

NP-hardness makes searching the space of possibly philosophies extremely time consuming, and has to be efficient by algorithms searching through that space in P-time, which humans seem to be decent at?

Like there's obviously a combinatorial explosion of possible philosophies

# Williamson on Conceptual Analysis

Williamsons formalization of conceptual analysis.

$\square (Kp \leftrightarrow JBTp)$
$\diamondsuit (\neg Kp\wedge JBTp)$

The problematic intuition of the case in the possible world where the JBT is not K.  

His argument is no different from relying on intuitions.

I reject all $T$'s of which contain intuition propositions.


## What are intuitions really?

Formal phenomnology. E = {V, A, T,...} for visual space V auditory space A and thought space T. T is most likely reducible to V. In the book varities of consciousness, there are two views primitivism and reductionism (and also eliminativism but let's assume that's false for thoughts). I take the reductionist route.

Why rely on the phenomenal experience of "intuition" rather than the phenomenal experiences of "regions of blue"? 

So I reject intuitions, the Ah-hah feeling, and cast skeptical reasoning towards a priori foundationalism, focuing on a empiricist foundherentism. 



# Conceptual Engineering as solution


Explicative Definitions however we want

Carnap
Chalmers


# Philosophical knowledge?


We thus get philosophical knowledge. Knowing a system $T$. 




# No philosophical progress?

Not quite true. But lack of it in some fields is cause for concern? Ehhh I guess lack of progress is only a concern whenever there is no finished consensus view that finishes in the establishment of something.

Add that article here

LLM's for progress?


With our formalisation we can now posit some progress. It's about the addition of systems $T$.  


# Moving onto science were progress is made

Consciousness Research and AI research is the best bet we have. 

A real case against the rationality of working on most issues in philosophy: AI may be able to do it for us in the future

Science is like philosophy anyways, but with observation sentences as premises. 

IIT vs GWT as the two competing models of consciousness.

But let's not take it too far.

# Obsession over language


With the rise of Ideal language philosophy and Ordinary Language philosophy, no more substantive claims. 

Nah, science can do that hah.


# "Common sense"?

Radically relative
Experimental philosophy


We could be radically wrong
Reid does take that to be the case. 



Moore and why the hand shifting argument doesn't work

# Mental States and Folk Psychology

Circularity without it?
Yet kinda bad and can be eliminated? Not sure tbh... Ask Youv



# Other ideas


A philosophy $H = \{P, L, f\}$ is a set of premises $P$ in system $L$ and a function $f$ which maps a set of premises to a conclusion

The set of philosophies is the study of philosophy

$PHILOSOPHY = \{H_1, H_2,\dots H_n\}$

 assuming a finite number here... which might not be the case

$PHILOSOPHY = \{H_i\}_{i\in I}$ for index set I
