["Criticizing philosophy is philosophy" is a bad objection to criticism of philosophy (lanceindependent.com)](https://www.lanceindependent.com/p/criticizing-philosophy-is-philosophy)


conceptual analysis, obsessive focus on language, questionable ways of employing intuitions


# Williamson on Conceptual Analysis

Williamsons formalization of conceptual analysis. The problematic intuitions are still there

$\square (Kp \leftrightarrow JBTp)$
$\diamondsuit (\neg Kp\wedge JBTp)$

The problematic intuition of the case in the possible world where the JBT is not K. 

His argument is no different from relying on intuitions.



# What are intuitions really?

Phenomenal experience

Insert formal phenomenology here?


Why rely on the phenomenal experience of "intuition" rather than the phenomenal experiences of "regions of blue"? 

So I reject intuitions, the Ah-hah feeling, and cast skeptical reasoning towards a priori foundationalism, focuing on a radical empiricist foundherentism. 



# Conceptual Engineering as solution


Explicative Definitions however we want


# Definition of philosophy


Use Jonas! definition, that's a good one


# No real philosophical knowledge?




# No philosophical progress?

Not quite true. But lack of it in some fields is cause for concern? Ehhh I guess lack of progress is only a concern whenever there is no finished consensus view that finishes in the establishment of something.


# Moving onto science were progress is made

Consciousness Research and AI research is the best bet we have. 

A real case against the rationality of working on most issues in philosophy: AI may be able to do it for us in the future


# Moral Realism?

But science can't do normativity, and that's bad, right?


# Obsession over language


With the rise of Ideal language philosophy and Ordinary Language philosophy, no more substantive claims. 

Nah, science can do that hah.
