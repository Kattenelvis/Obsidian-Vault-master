conceptual analysis, obsessive focus on language, questionable ways of employing intuitions

# Philosophy

A philosophy $H = \{P, L, f\}$ is a set of premises $P$ in system $L$ and a function $f$ which maps a set of premises to a conclusion

The set of philosophies is the study of philosophy

$PHILOSOPHY = \{H_1, H_2,\dots H_n\}$

 assuming a finite number here... which might not be the case

$PHILOSOPHY = \{H_i\}_{i\in I}$ for index set I

NP-hardness makes searching the space of possibly philosophies extremely time consuming, and has to be efficient by algorithms searching through that space in P-time, which humans seem to be decent at?

Like there's obviously a combinatorial explosion of possible philosophies

# Williamson on Conceptual Analysis

Williamsons formalization of conceptual analysis. The problematic intuitions are still there

$\square (Kp \leftrightarrow JBTp)$
$\diamondsuit (\neg Kp\wedge JBTp)$

The problematic intuition of the case in the possible world where the JBT is not K. 

His argument is no different from relying on intuitions.



# What are intuitions really?

Formal phenomnology. E = {V, A, T,...} for visual space V auditory space A and thought space T. T is most likely reducible to V. In the book varities of consciousness, there are two views primitivism and reductionism (and also eliminativism but let's assume that's false for thoughts). I take the reductionist route.

Formal Phenomenology proof/argument?

Why rely on the phenomenal experience of "intuition" rather than the phenomenal experiences of "regions of blue"? 

So I reject intuitions, the Ah-hah feeling, and cast skeptical reasoning towards a priori foundationalism, focuing on a empiricist foundherentism. 



# Conceptual Engineering as solution


Explicative Definitions however we want

Carnap
Chalmers


# Philosophical knowledge?




# No philosophical progress?

Not quite true. But lack of it in some fields is cause for concern? Ehhh I guess lack of progress is only a concern whenever there is no finished consensus view that finishes in the establishment of something.

Add that article here

LLM's for progress?

# Moving onto science were progress is made

Consciousness Research and AI research is the best bet we have. 

A real case against the rationality of working on most issues in philosophy: AI may be able to do it for us in the future

Science is like philosophy anyways, but with observation sentences as premises. 

IIT vs GWT as the two competing models of consciousness.

But let's not take it too far.

# Obsession over language


With the rise of Ideal language philosophy and Ordinary Language philosophy, no more substantive claims. 

Nah, science can do that hah.


# "Common sense"?

Radically relative
Experimental philosophy


We could be radically wrong
Reid does take that to be the case. 



Moore and why the hand shifting argument doesn't work

# Mental States and Folk Psychology

Circularity without it?
Yet kinda bad and can be eliminated? Not sure tbh... Ask Youv
