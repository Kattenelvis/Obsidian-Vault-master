Assume plants and trees feel sufferring

Would certain diseases on tree's/plants cause them to feel suffering?

If so, how cheaply can one protect many trees from suffering? 

There are 3 trillion trees and many other plants. Even if there's a low probability and only a small fraction feel suffering, that's still a lot. 

Integrated Information Theory: Small phi? Only some parts conscious? Individual Trees or multiple trees?


Total suffering by switching to vegan diets are probably worth it in expectation


Research question: Are there cost effective ways of decreasing suffering in plants?

> Plato
(1997, 1277), of course, supposed that plants are capable of sensation,
“pleasant and painful,”
