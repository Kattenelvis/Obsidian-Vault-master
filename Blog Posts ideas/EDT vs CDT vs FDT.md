decision theories

FDT implies murdering people??? Something to do with Roko's Basilisk



BostrÃ¶m meta-newcomb

The decision theory paper in my course on how for every thought experiment for EDT one can build for CDT and vice versa




Brief introduction to intuitions, method of cases etc?

CDT --> Ought(Two-Boxing)
Not Ought(Two-Box)
Not CDT

CDT --> Ought(Two-Boxing)
CDT
Ought(Two-Boxing)



The act itself gives you evidence that agents, atleast one's similar to you in some relevant way, will also act in that way, and you are rationally incentivized to act based on what evidence your act gives you.




Acausal trade, Hyperrationality

Yudkowski, TDT and FDT?

CDT is more intuitive


CDT
$EU_{CDT}(A) = \Sigma_{i=0}^n P(O_i) U(O_i)$
$EU_{EDT}(A) = \Sigma_{i=0}^n P(O_i|A) U(O_i)$



Take on a radically Humean approach: there is no causation, I'm trying to predict my field of sensations, so of course my actions is evidence for future sensation states


Or Determinism


QBism

Calvinism, or, in a deterministic universe, what you do gives you evidence. 


Pascal's wager and Roko's Basilisk



If we have $n$ choices with 2 options each, then there are $2^n$ decision theories?

And with say $n_2$ choices with 2 options, $n_3$ choices with 3 options etc we get a total of 

$2^n_2 3^n_3...k^n_k$

$\Pi_2^k i^n_i$




Alternatively, argument for EDT:

Humean causality
If humean causality than only EDT is true
EDT is true





An example: International politics. Imagine USA and China on an agreement. Realist interpretation. One uses CDT and the other EDT. The one using EDT and the other predicts? International politics newcomb.
