This is now a defunct blog post, look into [[3. Formal Phenomenology]]

Idealistic Possible world model

A possible mind, traffic light example, modellable by finite state machine

Push Down

LBA

Mind space (less wrong article)

Simulating other minds

Only one omniscient being since simulating a mind entirely requires having that mind as a subset and knowledge about experience. 

If we knew exactly what conscioussness was (had a mathematical mode of it) then we could create them in a computer (unless it's either non-computational mathematics or engineering problems would occurr). Data compression and AIXI

Hegel Hierarchy

Formalisation of phenomenal space and the space of all minds. Subsets and classes of phenomenal space, capable of different types of cognition, intelligences, consciousness and self-consciousness.

Discrete vs Continium: Challenging the arguments by Smith. Finitist Set Theory and its equivalent mereological system is probably complete and coherent. 
1. Urelements are discrete microphenomena
2. There exists functions between sets, a set at one timestep.
3. 

Mind space of an electron
{spinup, momentum, energy level} isomorphic with {red, 1hz 1db sound, 1 point of popcorn smell}
As an example. 

The isomorphism between phenomenal space and newtonian mechanics will be delivered in a future blog post.
