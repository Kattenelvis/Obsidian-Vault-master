Time: If time does not diverge or converge, then atleast one of the following must be true:
1. Time started
2. Time is cyclic
3. Time has been going on for infinity

Goals
1. There exists terminal goals
2. Goals are cyclic
3. There are infinite many goals

Epistemology
1. There exists axioms/dogmatic beliefs
2. Circular reasoning
3. Infinite chain of reasoning



Generalisation:

If, for every $x_i$ there is some (uninterpreted) implication $\rightarrow$, such that $x_i\rightarrow x_{i+1}$, then the following must be the case:
$x_1\rightarrow x_2\rightarrow \dots x_n$ 
$x_1\rightarrow x_2\rightarrow \dots x_1\rightarrow\dots$
$x_1\rightarrow x_2\rightarrow \dots x_n\rightarrow\dots$
