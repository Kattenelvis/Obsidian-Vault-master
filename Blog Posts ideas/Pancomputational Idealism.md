Alternative title/direction: Turing's phenomenological argument for the Church-Turing thesis. 


Shortly speaking, the CTT states that computations, such as say, multiplication, long division, finding the x of a polynomial, or calculating the co-homology group of a topological space, the way its done by a human can be perfectly replicated on a computer. 



[[2. Church-Turing Thesis]] applied to formal phenomenology


"The arguments which I shall use are of three kinds. 
(a) A direct appeal to intuition. 
(b) A proof of the equivalence of two definitions (in case the new definition has a greater intuitive appeal). 
(c) Giving examples of large classes of numbers which are computable." 
Turing 1936


Argument I:
"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. "We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book. In elementary arithmetic the two-dimensional character of the paper is sometimes used. But such a use is always avoidable, and I think that it will be agreed that the two-dimensional character of paper is no essential of computation."
No! It being 2D might be important, atleast, it's not obvious! A later proof showed that it was the case tho. 



"shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite. If we were to allow an infinity of symbols, then there would be symbols differing to an arbitrarily small extent"

Footnote: "If we regard a symbol as literally printed on a square we may suppose that the square is 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1. The symbol is defined as a set of points in this square, viz. the set occupied by printer's ink. If these sets are restricted to be measurable, we can define the "distance" between two symbols as the cost of transforming one symbol into the other if the cost of moving unit area of printer's ink unit distance is unity, and there is an infinite supply of ink at x = 2. y = 0. With this topology the symbols form a condition ally compact space."



Argument 1 Turing



Generalizing the argument 1 to multiple dimensions of phenomenal experience (2D visual space)



(Solipsism & Discrete/Finitelybounded experience) --> Church-Turing thesis

Which may be expanded into

(Idealism & Discrete/Finitelybounded experience) --> Church-Turing thesis


Since Idealism would be a multitude of discrete experiences who can perform computations. 




Harking to other phenomenological aspects of mathematics such as Brouwer meets Husserl on choice sequences and cognitive phenomenology and the Ah-hah feeling.
