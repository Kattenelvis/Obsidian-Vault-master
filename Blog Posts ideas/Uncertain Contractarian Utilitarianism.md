Harsanyi was claimed by Gauthier to be a contractarian utilitarian of sorts. Rawlsian ish.

Gauthier is closer to what I'm for though, given the coherence argument foundation.

Cooperate if everyone have the same preferences

Psychological hedonism is true, i.e everyone prefers more hedonic states over less hedonic states

Therefore, cooperate with everyone.



Social contract



Money pump --> Transitive preferences

Transitive preferences and complete preferences imply linear preference relation/utlity function

Dutch books avoids sure losses (what kind of preference relation is needed? A utility  should be sufficient, but is it necessary?). Impossible or atleast unfeasible in reality to accomplish (AIXI uncomputability). So we adopt hueristics and bounded rationality, but try to optimize first-order rationality as much as possible with this second-order rationality. 

Different bargaining positions for different individuals. Rawls argued for a original position to go out for. I reject this, it cannot provide rational support based on the reasons given by coherence arguments. There is no "view from nowhere". 

Persons-affecting view yes, ideal observer theory no. Moral realism no, there are no stance-independent and necessary moral facts.

A social contract is formed between different unequal agents. Support a generally equal system as cooperatively optimal between agents. Rule-utilitarianism could be established, human rights, norms, virtues etc. Social choice theory, game theory, optimization theory, economics etc can be used for finding optimum positions.

Thus we establish a sovereign, based on an improper subset (could be optimal for all to have the entire population in some cases). Anarchism is generally sub-optimal. We care less for future generations, so no intergenerational welfare economics although tbh it can be used to model a long lived population. Population ethics consequences in general? It's not good for anyone before they're born to be born. What about anti-natalist views where it's bad for someone to be born? What about transhumanism? What about fair cake division? So many questions!
