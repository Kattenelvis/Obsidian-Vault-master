Descriptivist Theory of names

All concepts can be reduced to sense-data expressions

Compare this to others:

""Which terms one counts as basic will depend on the solution one favours to Kripkeâ€™s sceptical problem. If one follows Maddy and McGinn, then the basic terms will be proper names and natural kind terms. If one follows Millikan, then the basic terms will be evolutionarily salient terms. If one follows Fodor, then the basic terms will be those whose tokenings stand in asymmetric nomic relations with their corresponding properties."

And David Chalmers book on constructing the world


Defend Ayer's and Carnap's Aufbau on this. Russellian descriptivism (or a more modern, more palpable version of descriptivism). 


Reduce all knowledge down to sense data (naturalized version?). 


Yup I'm really doing it fuck you anti-logical positivists fuck you fuck you omg i'm not angry I'm writing this really apathically but I probably could get angry over this if someone really pushed me. s
