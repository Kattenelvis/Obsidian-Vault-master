Not to be taken too seriously! But the idea is as follows:

Many worlds interpretation + Phenomenal ontology + Quantum Loop Gravity


The idea is that the finite and discrete quantum state which describes the world in MWI which doesn't involve any extra concepts such as quantum state collapse (merely vector split). The idea is that we can also map quantum states to points in phenomenal space in some way. Because both theories are discretized, we'd like a discretized theory of gravity aswell.

It's worth noting that actually carrying out this idea is hard and potentially lead to massive problems and may fail. I will have to thread carefully. I think I may begin with the simpler notion of mapping quantum states into states on phenomenal phase space. 


$\ket{\phi_1}+\dots\ket{\phi_n}$ 

We set up a mapping from quantum states to phenomenal states.

$f : H \rightarrow E$

$f(\ket{\phi_i}) = E_i$

As such, the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation which describes the dynamics of quantum states could also describe the evolution of phenomenal states. 

This seems to be a kind of dualistic epiphenomenalism or maybe even parallelism, since MWI doesn't allow mental states to affect quantum states. 


It's really just about restrciting phenomenal space under some natural laws which are identical to the one's in quantum mechanics. It's possible that other laws guide phenomenal consciousness (parallelism) or it's emergent in some way (emergentist physicalism). 


This gives some natural rise to the way mental fusions and fissions can work: Quantum entanglement???? Ok maybe not so natural risen.
