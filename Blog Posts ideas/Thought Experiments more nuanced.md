Ordered in how "good" I think thought experiments of that kind is.

Decision Theory -- Good and useful for they provide information on which decision theory is right in each case. There are correct answers to each thought experiment.

(Philosophy of) Physics - Thought experiment in physics can often provide interesting and unintuitive consequences of theories, such as Norton's dome, Newton's waterbucket, Schrödingers cat, Vingers hand and so on.  

Philosophy of mind - Some thought experiments can be generalized to a general argument such as knowledge gaps in the colorblind color-scientist case, what-it-is-likeness in Nagel's bat case, and the case of cognition in the Chinese room thought experiment, Frankfurt cases about free will, split and merged minds from Parfit and so on.

Ethics - Provides reasons to adopt some policy as part of a social contract or utility maximization. But that's just because it's pre-reasoned. So Not so useful in general.

Metaphysics - Provides conceptual intuitions for axiomatizations of those concepts. Not super helpful beyond that.

Philosophy of Language - The Gödel-Schmitt case is useless. 

Epistemology - More or less worthless. Bringing up intuitions on the knowledge concept. No worthwhile case of note.

Two major views on thought experiments: Empiricist and Rationalist. 


Meta-level thought experiment: Imagine a perfect world with nothing bad and everyone is happy and free. God reveals itself often. This world would not have a problem of evil. However they could imagine a thought experiment where the problem of evil occurs. In the end, a modal realist exists in this world, they might then point out about the problem of evil. See what we did here? We considered a thought experiment about what kinds of thought experiments can be done in the first place.
