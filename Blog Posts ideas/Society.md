I have not put up with a project on a society-optimization project that I've communicated outwardly. While I have made some articles on small, particular areas a few years back, there is a problem with that. Society is not a set of separated components, it's a very holistic system, and focusing on local minimums of small-scale optimization procedures fails to notice the global maximum. Optimizing for local maximum can be bad. Optimize for global maximum instead. A problem with neoclassical optimum calculations is that they are too narrow-focused on optimizing one variable in a small field. 

Firstly, society can atleast be modelled as a physical system, in particular, a dynamic cybernetic thermodynamic system. 

Definition of dynamic systems
The chaos theory hierarchy
Cybernetics

When it comes to thermodynamics, ecological economics and econphysics notice this perfectly well. There's a finite number of energy coming in $E_{in}$, and some amount of energy out $E_{out}$. Likewise, the economic system and the biosphere are trading energy and matter aswell, in a way where the econsphere is generally parasitic against the biosphere, where the econosphere extracts useful energy and resources from the biosphere, while dumping waste heat energy and waste matter back into the environment.

$E_{in} = E_{out}$
(With global warming that's not entirely true, we're soaking in energy into the oceans and energy is increasing on earth. Can be approximated on shorter time scales or longer time scales with no greenhouse gases)


We'll also establish an assumption: methodological individualism. While I did argue for compartmetn holism, I will still argue that institutions supervene on individuals. Individuals are what makes up the society, and can be seen as quantum particles while societies are the thermodynamic process that is emergent from the statistical interactions of those particles. 

Let's define an agent $A$. $A$ holds beliefs and desires.  
Risk, decisions, probabilities
risk-aversion, risk-seeking, EU maximisation

Now let's establish what we are optimizing for. There are countlessly many optimization functions one can have (even with multiple outputs!). So what do we do?

People are generally (maybe always) self-interested (a viewpoint called psychological egoism) and will take the path of least resistance (minimize free energy). Optimize for: Self-interest of many individuals

For simplicity, let's maximize EU for lowest utility individual. Leximin applies it over time, and has good properties.

We can enact total utilitarianism if we can solve the problem of other minds(?) Otherwise we may not know. Leximin rule collapses to total utilitarianism once everyone has the same utility (actually maybe not, since new decisions are not taken to screw over any one individual).


To eliminate worries from the Austrian school of economics: With future tech, knowledge need not be dispersed, approximate economic calculation is computationally tractable, and the problem of other minds [in my other blog post] may be solvable and thus utility functions may be objectively comparable. 

If this currently cannot be made, then there may still be legitimate worries. 



Important concepts:
- Formal Procedures for Social Decision making
- Optimal voting structure from social choice theory
- Optimal prisoners dilemma solutions (cooperative game theory)
- Ramsey's intergenerational welfare economics
- Recognize society as an extropic entity that increases entropy in the environment. Second law of thermodynamics, but earth is not a closed system. 
- Transhumanist potential and AI growth, posthuman society
- Economic base and class system

Energy, Matter, Capital, Technology, Labor, produces Goods

Goods can be reinvested for more goods produced at $t+1$, or consumed for utility/happiness

Ramsey welfare economics.
Compounds over time, good to invest a lot. Living on existence minimum?

With resource and energy constraints


According to econphysics and marxism, there are two wealth distributions based on different circuits: Active income and passive income. 
Boltzmann distribution vs Power law




Market-pressures are evolutionary fitness maximizing processes
Vs Planned structures (Paul Cockshot)


Graph theoretic resource distribution and planning. A problem with the current system is that a fish may get caught in Norway, packaged in Thailand, and then sold in Chile (or just goes straight back to Norway). Individual corporate agents are optimizing for cost-minimization as a part of it's overall profit maximization self-interest. 



Democratic planning
Distant Horizon planning

Coalition Formation


It may be a bad idea to focus on finding lowest utility individual at each time-step and maximize their individual utility. This may require too large of an effort with too large costs. 



Instead, focus on something good enough. Probability of finding them.
Which leads me to my not-properly-calculated-but-hopefully-good-heuristic list. To rank them based on how important they are would require real calculatons, which I won't do here (unless I do :eyes:)

- Fix Economic problems in the third world, global wealth redistribution.
- Poverty fund
- Cheap homes, large home building projects when needed
- Mental health support, including addiction
- LGBTQ rights
- Anti-Racism
- Universal Healthcare Coverage, including dentistry and medication. Focus on long term health. Disability rights and accommodation. 
- Strong education system, more democratic control by students and teachers and professors, less private corporate interests, free and open science without limits, mandatory pre-school, free school meals.
- Reliable and sustainable energy sector, consisting of renewable and nuclear power
- Sustainable agriculture, GMO is good. Anti-desalination. Permaculture?
- Genetic engineering on people for high hedonic set points
- Waste disposal
- Allowing controversial and offensive opinions. Freedom of organization, freedom of religion, freedom of speech
- Primarily rehabilitory prison system, a bit punishing to lower expected utility of committing some crimes. Never retributive
- Feminist policy, support both women's problems and men's problems. 
- Comprehensive public transport, walkable cities and mixed zoning
- Brain-Computer interfaces, improved cognition and intelligence
- Focus on minimizing X-risks, remove the taboo on X-risk discussions 
	- Global Warming
	- Pandemic
	- Nuclear War
	- AI
- Minimize disinformation, pseudoscience
- Legalize some psychedelics for healthy adults, legalize and remove the taboo on psychedelics research
- Liquid Democratic systems, utilizing score voting or some other optimized voting system (like quadratic which is even better for lowest utility individuals).
- Abolishment of military
- Focus on R&D
- Focus on animal welfare. Reduce or remove animal suffering, including wild animal suffering (if we can remove predation we should). Veganism
- Life-extension. Longer lives means longer lives that are happy and meaningful, increasing time-dependent happiness
- Normalizing polyamory and open relationships, which decreases jealously and allows people to optimize relationship configuration. Likewise, normalize asexuality and aromanticism. 
- Working towards an friendly AI utopian future society that colonizes as much of space as possible, where post-humans live in Nozickian experience machines as Dyson sphere's around stars. Eventually say bye bye to earth, it is a rock with lots of suffering on the surface. 


It would be an interesting project to try and calculate which one the above are right, or if some of them are wrong. Which one's would do the most good to focus on it what priority? 

Meta-structure: Centralism vs Decentralism?
Meta-structure: Rigidity vs Change?





The hedonic treadmill and genetic engineering. Genes for fewer hours of sleep.

Gale-Shapley algorithm and stable marriage theorem for arranged marriages and housing?
But two-ary marriage may be bad, allow opt-out and polyamorous? How does that change the algorithm?



Global state aggregates all social welfare functionals and wisdom of the crowd (jury theorems)

Global state allow for holistic, global infrastructure and coordination (preventing prisoners dilemma between nations). 


Idea: Minimum wage for sustaining workers (das kapital chapter 10 I believe?) is about energy exchange with the environment to prevent entropy. Food intake allows the body to extract work from the potential energy stored in the calories of the food, generating dissipative heat in the process. Having a home allows for less heat dissipation (given that there's also a heater and it's cold outside). 
But the main reason individuals do that may be to reduce suffering, and we have evolved to suffer hunger whenever entropy increases too much (or maybe more accurately, whenever energy storage is decreasing).
