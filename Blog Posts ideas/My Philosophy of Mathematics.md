Path for justifying paraconsistent relevance intuitionistic logic:

All paradoxes are version so self-referentiality. Simplest solution: Allow non-explosive logics

Choice sequences demonstrate that mathematical objects are constructed in consciousness. Unreasonable to think about contradictory constructions. We're only here to solve paradoxes, not have P(c) & ~P(c). I guess.

Relevance logic because it avoids the "paradoxes" of relevance I guess. 

Constructive neologicist mathematics. 

Lastly, an argument for logical monism. Why other logics "ought" not to be "accepted" (TODO: avoid value-ladeness).
