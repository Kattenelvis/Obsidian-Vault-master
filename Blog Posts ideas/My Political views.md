Some people will find these cursed, other's blessed. Which side are you on and why?

## The general system

Jury's theorem's. (Explanation). They can go wrong because of systematic faults such that the error-minimisation no longer applies. 

Liquid democracy (Explanation).

The delegates should have a lot of power, that there are stronger hierarchies in this sense. The hierarchies should be meritocratic, and all other hierarchies should be abolished as soon as possible. 

Prediction markets, where people bet money on the future, are used to incentivice people to build better models of society, economy e.t.c. such that the laws implemented will be better. 

## Various Reforms
Reformed academia: More funding, ensure that science and state merge such that the state can be used as a tool for experiment for social scientists, economists e.t.c. Strong naturalist scientific outlook of the world. More emphasis on bayesian approaches to prevent p-hacking from a dogmatic use of classical interpretations of statistics. 

Reformed family structure: Relationshisp anarchy for people who are not adopting children. Firmly established (maybe nuclear) family (hetero and homosexual allowed) are the only one's allowed to have/adopt children. A DNA database for everyone in the country, the people with the least genetic diseases, intelligence and other democratically decided genetic virtues are selected for and bred, eventually in artificial wombs in hospitals once the technology is there. This will put selectionpressures on what is democratically decided. 

Large and extensive welfare state, well funded hospitals, schools, daycare e.t.c.

The education system will have a large reform with larger degree of student freedom and democracy, modelled after (SCHOOL uhh sunset school?) in britain where students are allowed to choose which subjects to learn and when. Some core curriculum may be necessary but shouldn't take up too much space in the schedule. Massive funding for schools, universal kindergarden.

## Solarpunk future

Energy credits. One part of the solarpunk future is energy credits. People get paid some base amount they are allowed to spend each month on goods, enough to survive but nothing luxurious. People with jobs, where some pay better than others, get more energy credits that can be spent in stores where the credits are, instead of going into a store corporation, is instead marked out and cannot be used anymore. Instead the stores are co-operately owned. 

Rapid change towards well-planned sustainable cities. Massive establishment of public transport. 

The goal of solarpunk is to ensure stability, peace and to prevent existential threats such as global warming and resource depletion. 

Vastly increase nuclear power. Safe and good. Storage is not as big of a problem as previously thought, since AGI will mean everything will be vastly transformed within the next few decades and the "tens of thousands of years" won't happen because earth will have been transformed by then. It's better to expand nuclear power to prevent temporary global warming which could worsen stability and development of AGI. 


## Transhumanism

The social-democracy or semi-socialist society is only a starting point for the vastly greater long term project. This project involves setting sights towards a post-ideology. 

The long term goal is merging with technology in some way that will eventually make us completely indisginguishable from homo sapiens. 

Freedom will be much greater in a superintellignece hive-mind, since if freedom is defined to be the cardinality of action-space, then this set would be vastly larger. Not only that, but potential payouts/rewards and the speed at finding actions which yield maximum payouts/rewards is vastly greater too.
