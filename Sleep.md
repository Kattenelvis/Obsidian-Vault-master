Great comment:

Some more tips: 
1. Get to bed at the same time each day (otherwise you miss your growth-hormone spike and a process where usless information is cleared out your brain, you will miss them completely) 
2. No bright lights after 10pm, it will mess up falling and staying asleep (If you want to watch Netflix past 10pm look at the sunset, it will set your eye sensitivity and bright lights won‘t be that harmful anymore) 
3. Journaling 1/2h before bedtime helps to reduce stress and anxiety and to fall asleep faster 
4. Supplements to help fall asleep faster: L-Theaning is very calming and reducing stress (take 200-400mg), Magnesium (200-400mg) and electrolytes in 250ml water (helps preventing dehydration over night and through the salt water is kept in your body so you don’t have to go to pee). Take everything togehter on empty stomach ~1h before bedtime 
5. View bright sunlight in the morning (15min, before 10am), it will increase energy throughout the day and you naturally get sleepy in the evening
