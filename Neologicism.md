1. **Finitude:** It proves the existence of numbers of concepts with at most _finite_ extensions;
2. **Logical weakness:** it uses only _free intuitionistic relevant_ logic;
3. **Conceptual Adequacy:** It proves all instances of Schema N (for which, see below);
4. **Rigor:** It provides a ‘fully rigorous deduction of the Peano postulates’ (Burgess 2005: 147).[[45](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/notes.html#note-45)]
5. **Single-barreled abstraction:** Its basic principles are rules of inference effecting ‘single-barreled’ abstraction.
