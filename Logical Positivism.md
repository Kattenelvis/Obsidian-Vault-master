"Second, historians have shown that it is inaccurate to view logical positivism as an exclusively empiricist project. The movement has roots in a range of intellectual traditions including neo-Kantianism, Machian positivism, the Brentano school, and French conventionalism.8"

"  

I am rather sympathetic to logical positivism, but many of its core tenets are indeed false. I say this tearfully. Let's start with a few things:

**(1) Why the animosity toward logical positivism?**

As WokeUpABug mentioned, logical positivism was viewed as a defining feature of—if not identical to—analytic philosophy in the earlier half of the 20th century. To the extent that this is true, the animosity toward logical positivism is sometimes inflamed by the tensions between analytic and continental philosophers more generally.

Prominent logical positivists like Rudolf Carnap, for instance, ruthlessly attacked Heidegger and Hegel, accusing their work of not only being unclear, but being fundamentally comprised of "pseudo-statements" and other "metaphysical" nonsense that needed to be eliminated from philosophy. (See Carnap's "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" for an example.) The upshot, moreover, is that these charges could be generalized to _any_ philosophy that was conducted along such lines.

To the extent, then, that logical positivism is viewed as a defining feature of analytic philosophy (or as its most radical expression), some continental philosophers may view logical positivism as a kind of "arch-analytic" philosophy that, at its heart, is uncharitable to the continental tradition. In fact, I met someone recently who, after I introduced myself as someone trained in the analytic tradition, scornfully quipped "Oh, like the Vienna Circle?"

Second, even those considered to be working in the broader analytic tradition may have felt the need to disavow logical positivism in order to protect the legitimacy of their own projects. For example, the conventional narrative of 20th century history of philosophy includes the revival of normative philosophy in the 1970s through works like Rawls's _Theory of Justice._ More specifically, however, this revival was viewed as a revival _from the clasp of logical positivism_ and its emotivist non-cognitivism towards ethics.

Under the sway of A.J. Ayer, logical positivism in the Anglo-American world entailed non-cognitivism and emotivism about moral statements, where in effect, the kinds of statements involved in normative theorizing (such as "Murder is wrong" or "We ought to strive for equality") were reduced to emotives like "Boo murder!" or "Boo inequality!", and therefore not the kinds of things amenable to _rational_ analysis.

**(2) What was wrong with logical positivism?**

We know that many of the core claims of logical positivism are false. For instance, we know that the verification principle is false, and we know that the logical positivist's analysis of concepts like analyticity and necessity may be viciously circular. We also saw the demise of the logicist and formalist projects, which some view as important to the logical positivist's account of mathematical knowledge.

In order to save the verification principle from self-defeat (as Carnap did by endorsing something called the "principle of toleration"), one renders the VP considerably less interesting, if not largely toothless. (Under these kinds of amendments, the verification principle is held to be analytically true.) Under the principle of toleration, the verification principle just becomes "one way" or "one framework" among many from which to begin theorizing. Instead of being the "correct way" to conduct philosophy, logical positivism is reduced to a framework that one can choose to accept or reject depending on one's goals, in a conventionalist or instrumentalist vein.

> they sound a little bit like trying to argue that set theory is dead by bringing up the barber paradox.

This is a good point; however, paradoxes like the Barber Paradox afflicted what we know as "naive set theory" through its unrestricted comprehension axiom. Formal set theories easily avoid (and were formulated specifically to avoid) Russell's Paradox by eliminating the unrestricted comprehension axiom and replacing it with the _axiom schema of specification:_

`Given any set A, there is a set B (a subset of A) such that, given any set x, x is a member of B if and only if x is a member of A and φ holds for x.`

(There is some debate about whether the Barber Paradox really is just an instance of Russell's Paradox, but I shall not cover that here. See [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/).)

The moral, here, is that no comparable reparation or reformulation of the verification principle has been widely accepted. And furthermore, that in addition to the problems with many of logical positivism's other core theses, the problems with the verification principle are _not_ just limited to the self-defeat objection.

**(3) Where is logical positivism now?**

There has been some renewed interest in logical positivism. Some philosophers, most prominently Michael Friedman in _Reconsidering Logical Positivism,_ have held that our collective understanding of logical positivism has been unduly tainted by A.J. Ayer's formulation of logical positivism in _Language, Truth and Logic_, and that logical positivism was in many ways a subtle, neo-Kantian project.

There are still philosophers working under the broad influence of logical positivism, especially in the philosophy of science. For instance, Bas van Fraassen's highly influential "constructive empiricism" [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructive-empiricism/#ContLogiPosi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructive-empiricism/#ContLogiPosi) is largely informed by the logical positivist conception of science:

> One of the reasons constructive empiricism is viewed as significant is that it carries on the tradition of the logical positivists without being saddled with the problematic aspects of the positivists’ positions. The constructive empiricist follows the logical positivists in rejecting metaphysical commitments in science, but she parts with them regarding their endorsement of the verificationist criterion of meaning, as well as their endorsement of the suggestion that theory-laden discourse can and should be removed from science. Before van Fraassen’s _The Scientific Image_, some philosophers had viewed scientific anti-realism as dead, because logical positivism was dead. Van Fraassen showed that there were other ways to be an empiricist with respect to science, without following in the footsteps of the logical positivists.

Finally, David Chalmers's recent _Constructing the World_ follows explicitly in the footsteps of Carnap's _Aufbau der Welt._ (As Chalmers and Friedman are apt to note, the story we normally inherit about the failure of Carnap's project in the _Aufbau,_ as an attempted reduction of all philosophy and science to phenomenalism, is mistaken.)

For those sympathetic like me, logical positivism represented a powerful research program—one that gave birth to many deep insights and generations of fertile research. Perhaps this is only perceptible in hindsight, but in many ways, I wish philosophy had a clear and sweeping research program akin to logical empiricism to define and direct the work being done today.

The point, in any case, is that there are a lot of avenues for new research into logical positivism, and that logical positivism still exerts an influence on the work of many good philosophers today, even if logical positivism _itself_, in the crystallized form we often learn about it, is dead."
