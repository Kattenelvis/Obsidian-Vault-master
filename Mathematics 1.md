AI's are computational. But what really is computation? 

## Finite state machines and push down automata




## Turing machines


## Undecidability



## Curry Howard Correspondence
As such, the lambda calculus has a correspondence with first order intuitionistic logic.





## Computational Complexity: Can a big enough computer with enough time just solve any problem?



P = NP discussion

Quantum Complexty and quantum supremacy?

Brute force

AI as a P-algorithm heuristic that's a "good enough" approximation of solutions to NP-complete problems.



## Hypercomputation

If hypercomputers existed however, we'd just use brute force algorithms and even do uncomputable algorithms such as AIXI. Of course, how to align an AIXI would still have to be debated, but it would be really easy to have vastly smarter-than-human intelligence.


But it seems given current physics that it is impossible:

Closed timelike curves can build a hypercomputer!

CTC's are nomonologically impossible:

Gödel metric [insert Gödel story here, no Gödel, no spinningfound!]

Generalized Entropy
