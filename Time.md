"# Is Time Travel into the Past Metaphysically Possible? (Metaphysics of Science and Time)

[Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22&restrict_sr=1)

Time travel is a very popular idea nowadays and plays a prominent role in sci-fi literature. However, this idea has also become more popular in physics and philosophy. I am mainly interested in time travel into the past. From my reading so far, many physicists believe time travel into the past is at least scientifically possible as many argue that Einstein’s relativity has shown this (I believe Gödel also mathematically proved that time travel into the past is possible). I am not just interested in whether time travel into the past is scientifically or technologically possible (even though it is interesting to see what both general relativity and quantum mechanics can help reveal in this area of inquiry), but whether time travel into the past is actually metaphysically possible. I actually feel like this area of philosophy of time is sometimes neglected.

Some of the arguments I have heard used against time travel into the past include metaphysical paradoxes such as closed causal loops (bootstrap paradox and predestination paradox), the grandfather paradox, bilking (backward causation), Polchinski’s Paradox etc. I am wondering though whether these arguments are really successful in showing that time travel into the past is possible or not. I am also wondering is there a near-consensus amongst philosophers on whether time travel into the past is metaphysically possible.

I also think it is important to mention some key concepts as context for this issue of time travel into the past. These were some of my personal observations that I think is important before debating this question:

_1: Time, unlike space, does seem to have a distinguished direction:_

A) We only go forward in time, not back.

B) We cannot alter the past. We can alter the future.

C)Our knowledge of the past the future is very different.

So, intuitively, time does seem to have a direction. It is also appears to asymmetrical. But is time really asymmetrical?

_2: Different views within metaphysics about the status of past, present and future_

A) Past and present exist. Future does not. Known as Growing Block Theory (A-Theory of Time).

B) Past, present and future all exist. Known as Eternalism (B-Theory of Time)

C) Only the present exists. Known as Presentism (A-Theory of Time)

(A) Is most compatible with an asymmetrical understanding of time.

_3: Two arguments for thinking that time has a direction_

A) The second law of thermodynamics — The universe is evolving from a highly ordered state to a highly disordered state. This explains the direction of time.

B) Causation — Causes do not occur after their effects. The asymmetry of causation allows us to justify the claim that time is asymmetrical. But is it really the case that causes cannot occur after their effects?

_4: Backwards causation and time travel_

A) If we could travel back in time and alter the past, this would mean that causes could occur after their effects.

B) Time travel is physically possibly if our universe is shaped in a certain way (which we have yet to establish). But is time travel metaphysically possible? Admitting travel back in time would arguably lead to paradoxical cases (as I mentioned earlier), and these arguably demonstrate that time travel is not metaphysically possible.

/ So, does the notion of time travel into the past make sense? Is time travel into the past metaphysically possible? Thanks 🙏 /"

Answer:

"Great topic. There’s a lot to talk about. I might break up my responses into different threads. For reference, my background is physics with a strong philosophy of science interest. Popperian, fallibalist, anti-inductivist, realist.

> _1: Time, unlike space, does seem to have a distinguished direction:_

Sort of. It seems likely that directionality is an artifact of how our minds and subjective experience work.

> A) We only go forward in time, not back.

I mean… if we did go back in time (and not time travel), what would look different? Nothing. We’d unremeber things; so I’m not sure we can really say we don’t go back.

> B) We cannot alter the past. We can alter the future.

I’m not so sure that’s true either. First, consider that in a deterministic universe, we can no more alter the future than we can the past. It would be more accurate to say that we simply don’t remember the future yet.

What you’d be “sending back in time” metaphysically is really just information about the future, which in a deterministic sense is already there.

Second, let’s say you can alter the past. How would that look any different? We wouldn’t remember the original past. The altered past would comprise our current memories anyway.

> C)Our knowledge of the past the future is very different.

That’s an artifact of how our minds work. Entropy increases over time. Our brains need entropy to form memories. To a being without that need, like Laplace’s daemon, the past and future look identical. The distinction is arbitrary."

"> _3: Two arguments for thinking that time has a direction_

> A) The second law of thermodynamics — The universe is evolving from a highly ordered state to a highly disordered state. This explains the direction of time.

It does. Time does seem to have a direction at least locally in the sense that gravity seems to have a “preferred direction” locally to earth. It’s entirely possible that the entropy gradient is local (in time) to our relative position to the Big Bang. And in fact, it does seem like a sufficiently disordered future system would again lose this local entropic orientation.

> B) Causation — Causes do not occur after their effects. The asymmetry of causation allows us to justify the claim that time is asymmetrical. But is it really the case that causes cannot occur after their effects?

Causation is a human convention. It’s a way that we can identify entirely hypothetical human concepts like “but for” and “could have been” in a universe entirely comprised of only “is”.

> _4: Backwards causation and time travel_

A) If we could travel back in time and alter the past, this would mean that causes could occur after their effects.

I think that’s fine. It would simply be a different meaning for cause. Think about the mechanisms presented for time travel. You’re talking about a naked singularity. It’s already possible for literally anything to come out of one for no reason (cause) at all.

Further, it isn’t necessary that the traveler come from your causal chain. They could be entirely outside your light cone. Rendering paradoxes irrelevant.

> B) Time travel is physically possibly if our universe is shaped in a certain way (which we have yet to establish). But is time travel metaphysically possible? Admitting travel back in time would arguably lead to paradoxical cases (as I mentioned earlier), and these arguably demonstrate that time travel is not metaphysically possible.

I think our metaphysics simply must respond to what is discovered about physics. Metaphysics is a groups of theories informed by what is. Physics tells metaphysics what to do, not vice versa.

This can be largely disproven via physics. I.E. General relativity shows absolute simultaneity is an illusion and it is in fact only relativistic.

> B) Past, present and future all exist. Known as Eternalism (B-Theory of Time)

It seems pretty certain that this is true from a physics standpoint rendering the metaphysical subservient to this reality.

> C) Only the present exists. Known as Presentism (A-Theory of Time)

This is certainly false given simultaneity is false.

> (A) Is most compatible with an asymmetrical understanding of time.

I don’t think so given we know the asymmetry is well explained by how our brains require entropy to function."

Idea:

Antinomy: Either time started at time t=0, time has been going on for infinity, or time is cyclic (or some combination).

This is isomorphic to the sturcture of Münschenhausen lemma
