Great comment against a holucaust denier:

First off no, there were not really swimming pools at Auschwitz. The camp itself was built far from any major population centers and so there were no fire hydrants. This is a problem for a camp where there are lots of furnaces and other appliances which could catch fire. So a series of water reservoirs were installed for the purpose of fighting fires. These were just large pool-like structures with hoses. Auschwitz was a big camp- an insanely big camp. There were around 8,000 to 9,000 guards there at all times. I mean this is the population of a small town. So like any small town, there were things to do so that the Guards could have some fun in their downtime. Eventually, some diving boards were added to the reservoir so that Guards could go swimming. Prisoners, especially Jews, were never let anywhere near these makeshift swimming pools. This is another type of argument that exposes why deniers are always wrong and why nobody takes them seriously. Deniers have a pattern that’s pretty easy to notice. They cherry-pick minor details, misinterpret those details, overblow the meaning of those details, and remove those details from the larger context. Take this pool argument for example. Cherry-pick: There were pools at Auschwitz Misinterpret: The pools were for prisoners Overblow it: This means prisoners were treated well at Auschwitz Remove from context: Ignores the crematoriums, gas chambers, witness accounts, and evidence of genocide Almost every argument deniers use follows this same pattern. If pools were installed at Auschwitz for prisoner use would that make any difference? How does the existence of a pool invalidate thousands of eyewitness accounts, hundreds of documents, forensic testing, photographic evidence, and hundreds of confessions? World-renowned historian and Holocaust expert Jan Van Pelt stated “A favourite example of the negationists is the so-called swimming pool in Auschwitz. They argue that the presence of a swimming pool, with three diving boards, shows that the camp was really a rather benign place, and therefore could not have been a center of extermination. They ignore that the swimming pool was built as a water reservoir for the purpose of firefighting (there were no hydrants in the camp), that the diving boards were added later, and that the pool was only accessible to SS men and certain privileged Aryan prisoners employed as inmate-funcionaries in the camp. The presence of the swimming pool does not say anything about the conditions for Jewish inmates in Auschwitz, and does not challenge the existence of an extermination program with its proper facilities in Auschwitz.”
