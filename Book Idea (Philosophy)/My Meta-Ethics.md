Game theory and human society implies egalitarian rule utilitarianism


Axiological system $A$. 

All meta-ethical systems are a mathematical optimization over $A$.


Perhaps a function from possible worlds to a number. 
Partial order? [[]]


Argument from instrumental rationality (AIR):
If you want X, do Y
you want X
\-----------
do Y

With such an inference, naturalism can be kept. 



Moral universalism vs particularism:
The amount of extra axioms necessary to formulate particularism could lead to g√∂del's incompleteness theorems for a deotnic logical system. It could become strong enough to do arithmetic. 

Rule utilitarianism is about creating rules that are believed to maximise happiness. The rules make it easier, no need to calculate every action, only some set of axioms in deontic logic such that one can compute the theorems.

Virtue ethics could be helpful, to know when to break the rules. There is a combinatorial explosion of possible situations and the ethical action, especially in a quick decision, is unknowable. The algorithmic complexity of proving every actions ethnicity is likely very high, since the number of possible situations is very large (atleast the number of objects in the universe).



Ought-is:

Different in different formal systems

Principle of explosion means that all statements are true or false so you can imply an ought.

Otherwise needs some axiom that introduces deontic operators.



Moral intuition, intuition is what is stored in the DNA (pre-memory). So moral intuition is DNA-stored emotions regarding some actions. Generalising them to general ethical laws gets us some general view on what biological creatures with human DNA find repulsive. Different between different humans. 




Variables are a certain function from world-states to a number. Usually only requiring a subset of proposition about the world-state to determine it's value. M is measurement and X's are values of the variables measured 
$M_X(\{p_1, q_1\})=X_1$
$M_X(\{p_2, q_2\})=X_2$

Optimization over variables:
To get back to value theory, we can then min-max over variables. Generally speaking, maximising over one variable is easier and generates a total order structure while it can get computationally irretractable to optimize over many variables which also generates a partial order.
