Taking inspiration from Chalmers constructing the world. Smallest number of axioms for empirical adequacy and decision making?

---- Phenomenal Foundation
Integrated Information Theory (6 axioms)
Preferred states of consciousness (preferences and utility functions) (1 axiom?)

---- Mathematical Foundation (constructed in consciousness)
Constructive Logicism (Tennant) (like 3 inference rules)

---- Physics restricts possible experiences and restricts how experience changes over time
Axiomatized Gravity (? axioms)
Axiomatized QM (? axioms)
Axiomatization of other theories in general? (??? axioms)

Challenges:

1. It might be inconsistent. If we're using Tennants core logic, it is paraconsistent, so not explosive atleast. It might be fine that is it inconsistent, for this allows us to simply ignore worries about the incompleteness theorems.

2. Axiomatizing QM is a genuinely hard problem (is "sufficient arithmetic" derivable in Core logic enough?)

3. How do I know I haven't ruled anything else out?

4. Can this theory $T^*$ can hempel-schaffer reduce all other theories, or will some scientific theories be left out?

5. What about utilizing quantum IIT? 

6. Qbism justified from the preferences --> dutch books --> Bayesian reasoning --> QBism? Are more axioms needed about beliefs and betting predispositions?

7. What about the meta-language used to talk about the object-language that is the axiomatized theory?

8. Look over the article cited in "theory of everything (philosophy)" wikipedia page, about 7 axioms and an impossibility theorem. Includes principle of sufficient reason!
