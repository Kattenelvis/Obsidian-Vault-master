Two methodological problems with contemporary philosophy: There's not enough mathematical formalism, and the division between analytic and (truly good) continental philosophical methodologies of mathematical analysis and the phenomenological method respectively is a fake division. These may seem contradictory, however truly good continentlal philosophy such as the phenomenological method can be formalised mathematically. One example of this that has already been done in the past is Barry Smith's formalization of Husserlian phenomenology (source) formalised into formal ontology. 





Idea: I return to foundationalism, and it works like this (It's kinda like logical positivism?):
