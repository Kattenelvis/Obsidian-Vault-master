Probabilism and norms of coherence [Bayesian Epistemology (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/#SyncNormIRequCohe)

Idea: If I want to combine Doxastic logic and bayesian epistemology, rather than modelling each proposition, their conjucnts, disjuncts, negations and having each of them with a credence, there's instead a process which needs to have some formula as input and outputs a credence. It is not the case that all agents have all (infintely many) credences on the (infintely many) formulas that can be formulated. 


Idea: Variables are a function from a certain class of world states/system states to a number. Measurement means knowledge of those variables. EPR definition of realism: states which are not changed by measurement exist outside the mind. 
Formalised: 
$x=V(S)$ 
$K(x=c\pm \epsilon) = M(V(S))$
Quantum mechanics: System states change by measurment, for example sending photons at an electron to know it's momentum changes its momentum. 
Anti-realist defintion.
