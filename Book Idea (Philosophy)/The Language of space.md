The language of spatial composition, words used for spatial reasoning, AI reasoning of space, depth-perception, cognitive science. 


The visual field can also be modelled with a third location-variable such that one gets that for every visual point $v\in V_E$ is 
$v=\{x, y, z, h, b\}$ 

Or with generalized (for example, non-linear) coordinates it can be generalized to
$v=\{r_1, r_2, r_3, h, b\}$

Of course, proprioception and touch is also useful in this instance as they can also analyze depth. Even hearing once two soundwaves are somewhat delayed can lead to stereo sound as opposed to monosound which tells you something is behind you rather than infront of you. Or to the left or right depending on which ear is hearing the strongest. 

With the phenomeneology of depth analyzed one can begin to try to understand why there is depth in the visual field. Here's were our moderate epistemic naturalism (add this to section uhh 1 I think) comes in. AI research and perception research allows us to analyze this question.

There's also to imagine different points in visual space that form a polytope. One could then create a polytope within that polytope and get a smaller polytope inside of it.

And for objects one see this works for all of their points taken in combination. (And some more though, since the backside of the object is expected to be there).


Formalise it in mereology.
Now that we have 3 coordinates we can also formalise it mereologically.
