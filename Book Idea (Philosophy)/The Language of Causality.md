With the language of space analyzed one could analyze the language of causality aswell

With ordinary objects:
"Billiardball hits billiardball"

Reduced to the language of sense-perception:
"The lower white circle over time moves upward and has smaller radius and once it is only very slightly larger and somewhat overlapping with the upper circle the lower circle will stop moving upwards and becoming smaller while the upper circle moves upward and gets smaller radius"

This only works from one camera-perspective, one where you are slightly above. You can imagine different reductions of the ordinary objects to sense-perception with different camera perspectives in the way they would be talked about as ordinary objects.
