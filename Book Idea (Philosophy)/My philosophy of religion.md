Omniscience can be charactarised as knowing all of the axioms of the logical system that describes the world and, if given a theorem, can use the least time-complex algorithm to decide if that theorem is true or not.

Decidable theories. This charactarization can only really work if the theory is decidable. If it's undecidable, then either omniscience is impossible, or the algorithm is a hypercomputation. 

On the topic of big-bang information and laws of nature, for omniscience, if time-reversible, an omniscient being would have to know any timestep completely. Otherwise not. Russells paradox of having to containi itself? What about panentheism then, how can that be mathematically formulated?

Approximation of Omniscience: Superintelligence.
$Omniscience \subset Superintelligence \subset General Intelligence$

Theorem: Only one omniscient being since simulating a mind entirely requires having that mind as a subset and knowledge about experience. (Logical proof here)

$Omniscience \in Superintelligence \subset General Intelligence$ 
$Possible Gods  = Omniscients \cap Omnipresents \cap Omnipotents \cap Omnibenevolents$ 
Just like what GÃ¶del's Ontological Arguments first definition says, God has all 'good' properties. Mathematicall, it is written as
$G(x)\iff \forall\phi (P(\phi)\rightarrow \phi (x))$ 
For the God predicate $G$ (x is God) and the positive property $P$ ($\phi$ is a positive property).  This can now be more clearly defined in the space of all minds.  

$\{E\in E^* :\forall\phi (P(\phi)\rightarrow \phi (E))\}$ 

where set $E^*$ is the set of all possible minds. 




The Panentheism impossibility thesis: 
The theory describes everything in universe $U$. 
(What was I writing here?)


Omega-point cosmology and deism. 



From rationalism to empiricism:
Ontological argument
Cosmological argument
Omega-point cosmology
Teleological arguments
Fine-Tuning
Miracles

Historical research always yields the most likely answer, and cannot confirm the miracles, that requires faith which I have argued is not epistemically reliable. 




Is AGI a religion?

Omega point cosmology - Creator, purpose
Apocalypse/Heaven scenario
Roko's Basilisk - Pascals wager
One's purpose in life is to construct AGI

Religions are not necessarily wrong, and this religion must be the most rational of religions. 


Mereological relation:
Panentheism: Universe part of God
Pantheism: Universe part of God and God part of Universe
Theism: Neither
????: God part of Universe
Polytheism: Union of all dieties is a part of the universe

Once we introduce Deism, Pandeism and Panendeism we get into temporal logic aswell. 



Probability density function of the metaphysics of God:

Pantheism: 47% 
Deism: 20%
Panentheism: 8%
Agnosticism: 8%
Classical Theism: 5%
Atheism: 5%
Panendeism: 3%
Pandeism: 4%

Do more careful calculation in the future
