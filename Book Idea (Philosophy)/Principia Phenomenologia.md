All statements are revisable $\forall\phi J\phi$
Memory exists $\exists M_@$

$x=x$
$\neg(x\wedge\neg x)$
$\exists_{<\omega}x. x=x$

The system should upphold the following properties:
Finitely Axiomatizable
Consistent
Cannot be satisfied by infinite modells

Theorem 7.2.4 (First Incompleteness Theorem) Every consistent axiomatizable extension of PA is incomplete.

Prove that it is axiomatizable (easy, just count the axioms if they are finite or not) and consistent and NOT an extension of PA.
