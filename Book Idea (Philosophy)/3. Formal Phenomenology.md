The project of reducing the external world to the logical atomistic structure where each complex term is made up of phenomenal primitives and logical connectives did not die with logical positivism (or atleast, Carnap). In this post, I will argue for a return for such a project while taking into acount the falsity of the analytic/synthetic distinction by implementing Quinean naturalism and universal belief revision. In this post I will give the outline of the mathematical structure of phenomenal consciousness by showing how phenomenal space can be modelled by theory. I will finish with more speculative thoughts on the classes of different minds in phenomenal space. Process philosophy will be taken into account in a future blog post. TODO throw in tarski's truth definition somewhere in the abstract. 

General outline:
1. Tarski's truth definition for defining phenomenal truth
2. Set theoretic mind space
3. Translation between them
4. Empiricism
5. Time evolution and isomorphism to physics
6. Conclusion

# The Logic of Phenomena
The general structure of the epistemological system can be seen as the following: foundationalism of definitions, coherence in justification, uncertianty and scepticism. 

First, let's discuss truth, or to use a less controversial statement, correspondence. We are not discussing correspondence with an external world, but rather with phenomenal experience, which will be shortered to $PE$, which we'll later see is a mathematical set. 

Foundationalist empiricism of definitions: Primitive definitions are definitions that cannot be defined by any other terms. 
(Does "primitive defintion" define itself and if so russells paradox? Graham-Nelsson paradox?)

We can consider a statement $p$ that describes experience $e$ to be true iff $e$ 

We're now going to formalise these notions with Field's redefinition of Tarski's truth definition. Primitive terms denotes 

Which leads us to the question of whether or not primtive terms denote an abstract concept, or concrete particular experiences. And if we're talking about concrete particular experiences, is it a macroexperience (a subset of $PE$) or microexperience (a member of $PE$)?

It is convenient to introduce the expression 'primitively denotes' as follows: every name primitively denotes what it denotes; every predicate and every function symbol primitively denotes what it applies to or is fulfilled by; and no complex expression primitively denotes anything

Definition of $s_k$ 
![[Pasted image 20230118155103.png]]

< Idea >
Using Tarski's truth definition and have the primitive symbols denote concept of sensory perception. Correspondence with perception gives true statements. 

Primitive terms (the empiricist viewpoint) found in [[Semantics]]. Do I want to justify the empiricist theory of primitive terms? Or leave it as a premmiss?

Correspondance to sense-experience or phenomenology (the distinction being?). Are the primitive terms microphenomenal or macrophenomenal? How are they abstracted? Barkley?!

Avoiding gestalt primitive terms. Shapes and melodies are not primitive terms, but are made up of microvisual and microauditory phenomenal points.  
Actually: It might be fine to include gestalt primitive terms, so long as there is a translation manual between language with different gestalt primitive terms that preserves truth value. There could however be a minimally amount of primitive terms/natural predicates used to define everything else, which is what David Lewis proposes. 

# Phenomenal truths
Now to truth.

We will define a recursive structure for phenomenal truths, inspired by Field's work on Tarski's truth definition. We want denoted primitives to be part of functions to form terms, which inside a predicate form an atomic formula which when combined by logical connectives form complex sentences and propositions. Truth will thus have to be defined, which is whether or not the proposition correspond to experience or not.  

(Idea on phenomeanl primitives: They might not span the entire experience if say they only contain auditory primitivies despite a visual space)
Let $e_1, e_2,\dots e_n$ be a set of phenomenal primitives and $f_1,\dots f_n$ be a set of functions. Then 

$e_1$ denotes whatever it denotes
$f(e_k,\dots,e_n)$ denotes $e_i$ iff $f(e_k,\dots,e_n) = e_i$
$P(e_k,\dots e_n)$ is true 

Then the connectives
$\phi\wedge\psi$ iff both are true
$\phi\vee\psi$ atleast one is true.
$\phi \rightarrow \psi$ if phi then psi

Here are some visual representations:

$\phi \rightarrow \psi$
![[Pasted image 20230301111511.png]]


# Spanning Phenomenology

Span: A set of primitive terms $e_1,\dots e_n$ spans the visual field iff all true statements about phenomena can be made true using them. 

Counter-example: Let the following set of primitive terms: 
$e_1 =$ Audio with decibel > 20 and pitch > 10hz
$e_2 =$ Audio with decibel > 30 and pitch < 10hz

This doesn't span the visual field, for a start, but it also misses any statements about decibel < 20. So it does not span. 

Minimal spanning list: A set of primitive terms $e_1,\dots e_n$ minimaly span iff all true statements about phenomena can be made using $e_1,\dots e_n$ and any more would be redundant. 

Non-example:
$e_1 =$ Audio with decibel > 0 and pitch > 0hz
$e_2 =$ Audio with decibel > 0 and pitch > 10hz

$e_2$ is not needed.






Now fields view on Tarski's truth definition. 
Each variable $x_k$ in the language has a referent $s_k$ that is an phenomenal primitive. 

1. 
2. 
'red' denotes$_s$ the experience of redness
'loud' denotes$_s$ the experience of loudness
3. $\left\ulcorner f_k(e) \right\urcorner$ denotes$_s$ phenomenal object $a$ iff 
	1. There is an object $b$ that $e$ denotes and 
	2. '$f_k$' is fulfilled by (a,b).
	   Where $e$ ranges over the expressions in $L$

1. $\left\ulcorner p_k(e) \right\urcorner$ is true iff 
	1. There is an phenomenal object $a$ that corresponds to $e$ and
	2. $p_k$ applies to $a$
2. Recursive clauses...


I shall call them "phenomenal truths" to distinguish them from other kinds of true statements such as, if idealism is false and realism is true, there exists true statements regarding an "external world". 

Co-referential terms are terms that refer to the same thing in two languages, like "blue" and "bl√•" and "blau" e.t.c

![[Pasted image 20230213204050.png]]

"T2 defines truth without utilizing semantic terms, whereas T1 defines it only in other semantic term  If the purpose of giving a "definition" of truth is to enable you to do model theory, then the elimination of semantic terms from T1 gives no advantage. For what purpose do we want definitions for which the elimination of semantic terms is useful?"

We must now specify the character of the phenomenal objects and how multiple microphenomenal objects form complex expression for macrophenomenal and gestalt objects, including mathematical objects which justify an empiricist view of mathematical objects. 

Complex expressions expressible in FOL:
"There is an experience 'red$_{44}$' at location $x,y$ in the visual phenomenal field" Can generalize coordinates if the visual system is not a simple cartesian grid. "There is an experience 'red$_{44}$' at location $r_1, r_2,\dots r_n$ for some coordinate system $r_i\in R$ in the visual phenomenal field".

"I experience pitch$_{35}$ at decibel$_{74}$ in the auditory phenomenal field".

Then the atomic sentences are defined
$\phi \rightarrow \psi$
![[Pasted image 20230301111511.png]]

This gives us some really nice properties for language of phenomenal experience, it is completely compositional and atomistic.  


# No subjective or objective truth

Takedown of the difference between "objective" and "subjective" truth:

Objective and subjective truth as subject independent and dependent respectively.

Subjective: "There is experience pitch$_{35}$ at decibel$_{74}$ in the auditory phenomenal field".

Objective: "Subject $S_i$ is experiencing pitch$_{35}$ at decibel$_{74}$ in the auditory phenomenal field".

Theorem: There exists a translation from all subjective truths to objective truths.

This distinction might not be valid if objective and subjective truth is defined to be truth about the external world. This I will not discuss in this article. 

# Set theory 

Because it's first order logic we cannot predicate over sets, so if each visual microphenomena would be modelled as, for example $\{red_{44}, x, y\}$ then we would be predicating over sets rather than objects. Problems of phenomenal indexicals. 





In this post I will give the outline of the mathematical structure of phenomenal consciousness by showing how phenomenal space can be modelled by theory. We can then form a logic of phenomenology, using Tarski's truth definition. I will finish with more speculative thoughts on the classes of different minds in phenomenal space, aswell as implications on truth scepticism and external world scepticism. 

The idea that sets can be used to model phenomenal experience is not entirely new, as IIT already has done that [Entropy | Free Full-Text | Why Does Space Feel the Way it Does? Towards a Principled Account of Spatial Experience (mdpi.com)](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/12/1160) and the book on non-linearities in visual space. Other examples include that smell has a hyperbolic smell [Hyperbolic geometry of the olfactory space | Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq1458)  which we will cover later. Likewise with the well known fact of logarithmic loudness. As will be explained later, the exact structure and measure space on phenomenology is up to science to figure out, not individual introspection. But we can do a basic approximation of it. 

We will begin with formalizing visual space as it is the most easy to visualize and demonstrate (except for blind people). We can, for now, assume that visual space $V$ is merely composed of a cartesian two-dimensional grid where every point has a hue-value and brightness-value. According to the book on non-linearities in visual space, this isn't the case, but it is a temporary simplification. In colors for philosophers, there are arguments put forth that there can be multiple colors in the same region aswell, I will be ignoring that for now. The theory is in principle capable of incorporating such complications.

We can then start translating sentences written in phenomenal language into a language of sets. 

In Set-construction notation:
$V=\{v:v\in[0, X]\times [0, Y] \times [0, B] \times [0, H] \times [0, S] \}$

This gives us points such as 
$\{4,4,0.5,0.3, 0.8\}$

Which means that the point at position $(4,4)$, has a brightness of 50% and a hue of 0.3, which if we take a hue of 0 as red, then 0.3 would be some kind of orangy-yellow on the hue wheel with a strong saturation of 0.8.

We can then take subsets, and get what Ayer would've called a "sense-datum".  

$SD\subset V$

Which would be a certain region in visual space. An example of this might be, only points in the left side of visual space. Let $v(x)$ be a function which accesses its $x$ value:

$SD=\{v\in V| v(x) < 50 \}$

We can formalize the auditory system in a similar way as the following, again taking some simplifying assumptions by not considering the logarithmic nature of it. Just as we formalised visual points as a position-hue-brightness squad, we will formalise auditory points as loudness-pitch pairs, with a binary switch as to whether it is from the left or from the right. 

$A=\{a:a\in[0, D]\times [0, P] \times \{L,R\}\}$

So for instance, a 1000hz sine-wave in the left audio channel (left ear) at a human-speech level loudness of 70db would be 

$a_1 = \{70,1000,L\}$

Now for touch. Assume there is a subset of a human touch-space, a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$. So if we let $H\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ be a human-shaped subset of 3-dimensional flat space. Then the touch phenomena is a subset of that $T\subseteq H$. 

Given empirical evidence that there exists only a finite number of touch-receptors, once can formalize it instead as a subset of a discrete vector space such as $T\subseteq H\subset\mathbb{Z}^3$. 

To borrow terminology from constitutive panpsychism, we can now refer to microphenomenal entities like the following:
$v\in V$$
$a\in A$$
$t\in T$$

We  can now define an entire phenomenal field as 

$E = \{V\times\dots\times F \}$

Which makes $E$ the space of all possible minds. We will call $E$ *mind space*. $E$ here stands for "experience". We can then index other experiences, such as say, some random rabbit, as $E_üê∞\in E$ . And so on. 

We mark "The" experience that's currently happening right now to YOU reading this as $E_@\in E$ where the "@" symbol is inspired by the "actual world" in possible worlds semantics. What $E_@$ refers to changes over time. 




We can now create sets based on true statements on phenomenal language
$\{ v\in V : \phi(v) \}$

For example
My visual experience of looking at *a cup* = $\{v\in V : v \in Cup\}$ 

(For problems regarding names of ordinary objects such as "a cup" will come in later chapters when we introduce the language of ordinary objects)

We can also do more complicated sentences

My visual experience of looking at and holding *a cup* = $\{v \in V: \textrm{region } C_v \} \cup \{f \in F: \textrm{feeling } f \textrm{ in region } C_f \}$
Which is equivalent to
$\{(v,f)\in V\times F: \textrm{feeling } f \textrm{ and seeing } v \textrm{ in region } C\}$


[Visual space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_space)
CALL IT VISUAL SPACE NOT VISUAL FIELD


We  can now define an entire phenomenal field as 

$E = \{V\times\dots\times F \}$

Which makes $E$ the space of all possible minds. We will call $E$ *mind space*. $E$ here stands for "experience". We can then index other experiences, such as say, some random rabbit, as $E_üê∞\in E$ . And so on. 

We mark "The" experience that's currently happening right now to YOU reading this as $E_@\in E$ where the "@" symbol is inspired by the "actual world" which uses the same symbol in David Lewis's possible world theory. Our discussions on solipsism in [[SCEPTICISM CHAPTER]] demonstrated the unknowability of what can now be described as the complement of the set $E_@$, usually denoted as $\overline{E_@}$. 

We can then take a special subset of $E$ which we will call "current experience". This is the set of experiences that are currently taking place, where $E_@$ will obviously be included. Since this is time indexed, though we will not discuss change in this chapter, we will call it $E_t$ for a time point t

$E_t = \{e\in E: \textrm{ all statements about } e \textrm{ are true } \}$

TODO: Add pictures of mind space.



## Multiple colors in the same region

Recent research [Colors for philosophers] indicate that a subset of visual space $S$ can have multiple colors as once. In the book, he claims that philosophers make the mistake of assuming that the nature of color  is a logical one. He however argues that it is an empirical question, especially regarding the fact when $F(S)$ and $G(S)$ can both be true for color predicates $F$ and $G$. 


## The topology of phenomenology


Open sets
Closed sets
Continious functions defined on visual space

# Applications to phenomenology

## Algedonic phenomenology

Algedonic phenomenology is about pleasure/pain (Uriah Kriegel the varieties of consciousness).


Daniel Dennett and Eliminativism of pain sound sreally based. Morphine is repported that patients feel pain but that it is not bad.

"What should we make of Dennett‚Äôs position? One question concerns the concept of pain. It‚Äôs true that we ordinarily assume that pains are intrinsically awful and that we have infallible first-person access to them, but it is arguable that neither feature is essential to pain as we ordinarily conceive of it. Perhaps folk psychology allows that we could be wrong on at least one (if not both) of these points and yet still be talking about pain. Perhaps morphine cases involve highly unusual pains (pains that aren‚Äôt awful), or perhaps they involve failures of selfknowledge (and those on morphine merely think that they are in pain). In fact, the idea that pains are not atomic sensations but are rather complex states with sensory, hedonic, and motivational elements is received wisdom in pain science. Although the various aspects of pain usually co-occur, there are conditions ‚Äì such as those to which Dennett draws our attention ‚Äì in which only some of these elements are present. In such cases, perhaps there is no fact of the matter as to whether the individual in question is in pain. But to say this is not to deny that pains exist; it‚Äôs rather to hold that pains are more complex than we thought. To go down this route would be to embrace revisionism rather than eliminativism with respect to pain"
Dennett 1978a

Three different views: Eliminativist, Reductivist, Primitivist





# Emotional Phenomenology

Emotional phenomenology has a long history of analysing the first-hand experience of emotions, the what-it-is like to have an emotion. Just like earlier, there are three different views [source] Eliminativist, reductivist and primitivist. Again, in this article the truth value of each is not evaluated, however it is formalised in set theory and the three hypothesises could potentially be scientifically falsified or verified.  

Eliminativism: $\neg (M\in E)$
Reductivism: $M=\{A\in E:\exists c. c\in A \wedge c\in M\}$
Primitivism: $M\in E$


# Cognitive phenomenology

[The Nature of Cognitive Phenomenology.pdf](file:///C:/Users/offic/Documents/Books/Philosophy/The%20Nature%20of%20Cognitive%20Phenomenology.pdf)

Does cognition such as the thought of 2+2=4 be reducible to other phenomenal experiences? 

Using our 
Three different views: Eliminativist, Reductivist, Primitivist

Using our developed phenomenal language and set theory we can now solve this question. Take the experience of thinking "2+2=4", there seems to be something that which it is like to be thinking about 2+2=4. The eliminativist position is thus comepletely unfounded, as it lacks any ability to explain why there seems to be something that it is like to be thinking 2+2=4.

So then we get to the more interesting question of Reductivism vs Primitivism. 

Let $M$ be a mathematical thought, such as "2+2=4" for example. Then 

$M\in E$


Choise sequences and phenomenology book reference here

It seems like many philosophers constantly assume cognitive eliminativism, in the sense that there is no experience of mathematical or other "a priori" objects. The idea that there is nothing to be thinking about a number is absurd, with a small amount of introspection it's just as much of an experience as any other of our thoughts. As a consequence, mathematics is justified a posteriori and the hypothesises are a lack of contradictions given some statements and the experiments are derivations. 

Self referentiality. 
Since we experience mathematical objects, and we're using mathematical objects to describe the experience of mathematical objects, could a mathematical object describe itself?
$[E_@]\subseteq E_@$ 

Where the brackets indicate symbol which refers to itself. 


So mathematical and logical objects are clearly phenomenal. 

[IRREDUCIBLE COGNITIVE PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE AHA FEELING.pdf](file:///C:/Users/offic/Documents/Books/Philosophy/IRREDUCIBLE%20COGNITIVE%20PHENOMENOLOGY%20AND%20THE%20AHA%20FEELING.pdf)

Hmmm UNLESS the "AHA!" experience is irreducible. A property such as being in a (mental) state of awareness of the meaning of a proposition or being in a (mental) state of awareness of the truth maker of a proposition might be irreducible. 

I wonder if that can be expanded to memory and mental images. Most certainly can, since one's awareness of the meaning of a proposition is phenomenologically awareness of the inner auditory sense of the proposition as it's heard in thought. So it can be generalized to say, our mental imagery or smell. 

What about aphantasia?



# Religious Experience

In the book "different kinds of religious experience" blah blah


It is also reduction to other experiences.


# Action Experience

Actions are also reductive.


# Mind Classes

Complex definitions and gestalt objects

Cup $=_{df}$ Sight experience of cup $\wedge$ Tough experience of cup 

Properties derived from similarities in complex objects. Belief formation about complex objects. Causality between complex objects. Theories about complex objects. Coherence between theores, theory ladeness. Bracketing. 

There are then different minds $\{M_i\}$ and they can all form a class of minds. 
$\{M : \phi (M)\}$  for example, is the class of all minds where $\phi (M)$ is a true statement. For example

$\{M : \exists X\subset M \wedge Red(X) \}$

Would be the class of all minds such that there exists a subset of the mind that is red. It excludes all minds that does not have a red spot in their visual field.

More advanced classes may thus be constructed
$SE = \{M : M \textrm{ is sentient} \}$
$SC = \{M : M \textrm{ has a self concept} \}$

And perhas one can show theorems to be true such as 
$SC\subset SE$

to be true or false, though we do not do so here.

$\{ M : M \textrm{ is Human}\}$

A lot of these sets can be vague, in which case some function to determine "how much" they belong to a certain class of minds in mind space they belong to. "Being human" is, atleast by posthumans, considered to be a vague predicate, there is no clear demarcation from human and non-human. 


# Discreteness vs Continuity

In [[2. The logical structure of the world]] we discussed the L√∂wenheim-Skolem paradox and Putnams paradox. The solution we proposed was to not allow a complete theory of the world to contain an infinite number of items. And any complete theory of the world will contain all phenomenal points. Thus we will rule out the following possibilities:

Non-infinite extent of phenomenal points:
$|E| = \aleph_0$
$|E| = \aleph_n$ for all n

Discreteness of phenomenal points:
Take hue for example, from $[0,H]$ (including the topological property that it is a circle and $0=H$.). It must then be the case $H\in\mathbb{N}$. 


# Empiricism, Biophenomenology, Heterophenomenology and Husserlian Phenomenology

Heterophenomenology, Dennett

The idea that an individual, atleast a human, can themselves figure out the primitive terms, is not something I believe to be highly reliable to yield true statements. Instead, the primitive terms are discovered through thorough empiricism and inter-subjectivity via phenomenal conscioussness model building using methodologies like Heterophenomenology and Biophenomenology. 

Heterophenomenology is also how we get to question on how it is like to be a bat. The notion that there could exist new, completely different phenomenal primitives that humans (currently) don't have direct experiential access too, is a very interesting and humbling one. This means that we cannot claim that any list, even of perfectly healthy human introspection, of phenomenal primitivies is a complete one. Once we're able to experiment on separation/combination laws, computational mind upload e.t.c then we'll be able to better understand which possible phenomenal primitives are out there. 

Speaking of separation laws, what if they are computational? "His discussion revolves around his imaginary Olympia machine, a system of buckets that transfers water, implementing a Turing machine. Maudlin‚Äôs main target is the computationalists‚Äô claim that such a machine could have phenomenal consciousness." So each water molecule has rudamentary phenomenal consciousness, the system as a whole has some emergent phenomenal consciousness given by the combination laws which are computational in nature. If computational process, then there exists a phenomenal process. Even for a human brain, each neuron from it's changing potentials and neurotransmitter recieval/delivery can be it's own separate phenomenal consciousness while building up a complex computational system which has it's own system. 

Separation laws and combination laws don't need cosmo/pan psychism. They can be generalised.

The mathematics of combination/separation laws:
Let $\{x_1,\dots x_n\}$ be a set of objects and $\{P_1,\dots ,P_m\}$ be a set of phenomenal properties. 
Microphenomenal experience: $P_a(x_i)$.
Macrophenomenal experience: $P_b(x_j,\dots,x_k)$
As natural laws (universal generalizations):
$\forall x_i. P_a(x_i)\rightarrow P_a'(x_i)$
$\forall x_i. P_b(x_j,\dots,x_k)\rightarrow P_b'(x_j,\dots,x_k)$
$\forall x_j,\dots\forall x_k. P_b(x_j,\dots,x_k)\rightarrow P_b'(x_j,\dots,x_k)$
$(\bigwedge_{j=0}^{j=k} P_a(x_j))\rightarrow P_b'(x_j,\dots,x_k)$


In the future, brains can be constructed and edited in ways such that inter-personal confirmation is possible and combiation/separation laws can be scientifically evaluated. 

Setting up an experiment to test the supervenience thesis: 
Definition: Mental x supervenes on physical y if a change in x is necessarily a change in y. You cannot have two same y and have two different x. Testing this experimentally means putting physical objects in such a way such that the phenomenal experience is different but the physical system is exactly the same (Elaborate more). 



Biophenomenology studies the interaction between experience and physical substrate that correlates with experience. The causal processes can thus be intersubjectivitily verified by constructing experiments with counterfactuals. "If I trigger these neurons, then we expect the person to report on this phenomenal experience". 

That smell is hyperbolic, or the visual field is composed of hexagonal pixels in a non-linear grid are some current scientific theories about the nature of phenomenal consciousness. That these processes are to be somehow introspectively discoverable like with Husserlian phenoemeonology is something that I strongly believe to be false. 

The mathematical structures can thus be unravelled. Measure spaces and so on. The fallacy of one's own mind is to be avoided, other minds have different features (colorblindness, deafness, aphantasia, queer sexuality/gender e.t.c). And it's a fallacy to believe one's own mind to be any kind of default, even among the mind-class of humans.

# Future ideas

Time evolution of minds, how they evolve over time, aswell as the special place of memory (is memory a subset of mind?) in the theory will be discussed in a future post. Minds and Physical systems have isomorphisms; a physical system can be represented as a mind and can thus be visualised. This blog post is under construction.



# Diverse Ideas

We can introduce the language of physical objects, including primitives (like space points, temporal relations, extension e.t.c) and a perhaps a translation manual between phenomenal statements and physical statements. Perhaps the physical object language can be split into observables and unobservables. Then we have a longer translation

Phenomena --> Observable physical objects --> Unobservable physical objects
or 

Phenomena --> Unobservable physical objects
Phenomena --> Observable physical objects



Scientific realism or anti-realism

Belief revision of a complex sentence. 
Disconfirming a belief: $P(S|E_i)>P(S|E_{i+1})$
Confirming a belief: $P(S|E_i)<P(S|E_{i+1})$

Problem of induction. The newly added evidence in the larger set $E_{i+1}$ can increase or decrease the probability of a complex sentence S. 
What about Quinean global support? Other theoretical sentences can be a part of $E_{i+1}$!

This is why Bayesian > Inferentialism!!! A case for changing science!

Orthogonality thesis/Hume's guillitotine: Why science is not value-driven. A global act axiom is needed to justify any act, sentances with the word "should" in it.
Example of modus ponens with ethical axiom:
(1) You should take actions that maximise happiness
(2) Eating x chochlate bars will maximise happiness
(3) You should eat chocholate

Formalised:

$\forall x. max_x(H(x)) \rightarrow O(x)$
For obligatory modal operator $O$ and happiness function $H$ and action x. 

$max_x(H(x) = H(a)) \rightarrow O(a)$
Therefore
$O(a)$


Williams says this: "Epistemic foundationalism does not really offer external constraints on our beliefs" is this uuhh, important?

Collective science? Takes place in sociology? 
A combined subject increases the number of sense-data, observation sentences, complex sentences and number of models and theories. It's only a sped up and there are no emergent collective structures. Institutional problems (for academia or corporate science) can affect the accuracy, negatively, for epistemic virtues on larger scale.

It is contradictory to say "There exists no blue to x<4 in the visual field" and "There exists blue to x<3 in the visual field"

Logical phenomenal atomism


[Rudolf Carnap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap "Rudolf Carnap")¬†introduced a terminology distinguishing between logical and non-logical symbols (which he called¬†_descriptive signs_) of a¬†[formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system")¬†under a certain type of¬†[interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic) "Interpretation (logic)"), defined by what they describe in the world.

A descriptive sign is defined as any symbol of a formal language which designates things or processes in the world, or properties or relations of things. This is in contrast to¬†_logical signs_¬†which do not designate any thing in the world of objects. The use of logical signs is determined by the logical rules of the language, whereas meaning is arbitrarily attached to descriptive signs when they are applied to a given domain of individuals.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-logical_symbol#cite_note-1)

Assume that there exists a belief set for each permutation of the statements $p, q$ (i.e $\{p, q\},\{\neg p, q\},\{p, \neg q\},\{\neg p, \neg q\}$ and call these "meta-narratives". Assume one fourth of the belief-having subjects believe in meta-narrative $\{p, q\}$, another quarter in $\{\neg p, q\}$ e.t.c. And assume one belief-having subject is a post-modernist who is annoyed that no one can come to agreement, and believe every narrative is equally true, just different perspectives. The post-modernist will be wrong. The first meta-narrative is the correct one. This can be extended to any set of propositions and truth values for the propositions (including multi-valued and fuzzy logic, and in some instances you end up with uncountable many meta-narratives). 



Primitive terms:
Can point any experience and name it.

Mimimal realization of primitive terms for describing phenomenal terms.

Beatle in a box, some people with more coarce-grained minimal realization of primitive terms. Like colorblind vs non-colorblind.

Husserls Bracketing. Angrippas Trilemma. Word definition coherentism vs foundationalism. 



Panpsychism has combination laws, cosmophysicms has separation laws. 

Panpsychism formalised:
Panpsychism is true iff the following proposition is in $T_\omega$ : $\forall x P(x)$ for phenomenal property P. 

Combination laws could be used to analyse the phenomenal experience of other objects. Imagine an invention that connects a human brain and can be placed on any object in other to experience what that object experiences. Such an invention would take advantage of mental combination laws. An invention like this could be invented over time using neurophenomenology, like for example adding neurons to the brain and repporting new phenomenal experience, as a way to understand the combination laws.

Alternatively separation laws. Imagine a berkleyan universe where everything is in God's imagination. This means that while there is a universal experience and subject (god) there are also set up separation laws which separates different sub-imaginations. A different theory could be bernado kastrups analytic idealism where he proposes that the universe has dissociative identity dissorder. I don't yet know how to formalise cosmopsychism into first order logic.  

Then it's just formalised like any other natural law. Let $P, Q$ be phenomenal properties. Then we could say $\forall x P(x)\rightarrow Q(x)$ which indicates a law-like statement (universality) maybe that every time x has experienced red in region A, it experiences green in region B. These laws could then maybe be extended to be necessary, not merely contingent given some notion of natural law. There could even be correspondance and interaction rules with non-mental rules which could solve the mind-body problem. 

Gunky and Junky phenomenology. Part and parthood forever. Reminder that consciousness seems bounded so it can't be Junky. Atleast $E_@$ isn't junky. It probably isn't Gunky either considering the finite computational capacity of the brain and some empirical results for trying to find the smallest piece of experience.


Absolute vs Relational space: If object $ob$ that the theory predicates over has the property "is at location $(r_1, r_2,\dots,r_n)$ for generalised coordinates $r_i$", then it only needs $n$ pieces of data to describes its location. If the set of objects in the universe is $|d|$ then every object needs a relational property with every other, so you get the 2-ary predicate "is at location $(r_1 - q_1,\dots, r_n-q_n)$ for generalised coordinates $r_i$ for the object and $q_i$ for some arbitrary object". This would be vastly more complicated. The amount of predicates for absolute space would be $n|d|$ while the amount of predicates for relational space would be $n|d|^2$. 


Algorithmic complexity theory: The smaller the theory of the world iff the smaller it's algorithmic complexity. 


Theory ladenness: Once we have introduced the language of ordinary objects, the definitions of these objects can be different, radically different so. In this sense, if the meaning of a word (in the language of ordinary objects) is determined by its connection with other words (in the language of ordinary objects) then there would still be structures that can be found. This could imply that evidence is still accumulative.

There are also fuzzy predicates on the objects measured. What counts as object x? This can be arbitrarily divided. 

"(3) Moreover, Kuhn extended the claim that observation is theory laden to say that¬†_all_¬†major aspects of a science are laden by the others. Substantive data and theoretical claims, methodological standards, goals, and even the social institutions of science are all bound up in mutual dependence. (The received view had kept them separate and independent in order to avoid mutual contamination allegedly leading to circularity; see Scheffler 1967.) It is this internal feedback that introduces the interesting, nonlinear dynamics into Kuhn‚Äôs model, since the feedback produces coupled interaction terms (Kuhn 1977: 336; Nickles 2013b; De Langhe 2014b)."


## Scepticism against internal mental states

Some reductive materialists sometimes argue against mental states such as beliefs, desires, emotions and so on. I will argue that beliefs are primitive while desires and emotions exist but are derivatives from more fundamental microphenomenal experiences. 


## The language of ordinary objects


The language of phenomena can be extended by introducing new primitive terms such as temporal, spatial and so on which could form the language of ordinary objects. However compositionality is no longer retained, because of 'grue' and 'bleen' are now definable, and 'blue' and 'green' are in turn definable by grue and bleen, which means that statements including the term 'green' include terms with holistic definition/defined by a holism. 

From SEP: [Epistemological Problems of Perception (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/#DireWorlInvo)
"2.1.2 Referential Directness
Another way that perception might be direct is if perception represents external objects, as such, without that representation being mediated by representation of other things. Contrast this with the classical empiricists‚Äô opposing view, that the only way to represent external objects is as the cause of our sensations (Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710). One might worry, however, that unless perception puts objects directly before us, we are in danger of not genuinely being able to think about the objective, external world at all, but only about ourselves. To say that perception is referentially direct is to say that the ability of perceptual states to represent does not depend on the ability of other states to represent.""


Is dualism only formalisable in second order logic?
$R(P)\rightarrow M(P)$ 
If P is "private", then P is "mental". Alternatively brentano:
$I(P)\rightarrow M(P)$
If P is intentional, then P is mental. 


The language of sense-data is extensional and compositional. If phenomenalism is true then logical atomism is true. 




A tree without leaves is somewhat blocking the view of a white hospital. Different views of perception may grant that there are overlapping "perceptions" on certain phenomenal points/regions. The white of the hospital is experienced "behind" the browness of the tree, according to maybe naive realism and intentionalism. But perhaps not according to sense-datum theories. 



Creating an association between a sense data and a mental symbol is a function of awareness. The mental symbol is now associated with the sense data and the mental symbol can generate said sense data. This is what we call the reference of the mental symbol. 



## Touch


At one timestep there is a subset of a human touch-space, a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$. So if we let $H\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ be a human-shaped subset. Then the touch phenomena is a subset of that $T\subseteq H$. 

Given empirical evidence that there exists only a finite number of touch-receptors, once can formalize it instead as a subset of a discrete vector space such as $T\subseteq H\subset\mathbb{Z}^3$. 

Idea: You can claim that distance one is normalized such that 1 is the smallest perceptible distance.

Idea: There seems to be a connection between pixel updating and touch updating which indicates movement, but this is not the case for shifting pitch or loudness in the auditory system.
