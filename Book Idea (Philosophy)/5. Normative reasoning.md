But utility functions have problems, from the Von Neumann Morgensten Representation theorem:
$U(a)>U(b) \iff a\succ b$

But this theoerem requires that the preference relation is transitive, complete and . and ..  

This is somewhat problematic, since it's not entirely certain we can rationally have a completely transitive and complete preference relation. It has been argued [cite] by [whom] that while it is empirically false, even for a perfectly rational agent, it is still unreasonable to assume this when it comes to all possible states of affairs. Completeness would then be nearly impossibe, as one would have to not only quantify but actively sort all possible worlds into a total ordering without any loops. This may be even impossible to uphold. Even for potential future advanced AI systems. 

So instead of unbounded rationality and maximising, we'll be theorizing about bounded rationality and satisficing instead. 


### Instrumental Rationality: Risk averse well-being satisficing and one-boxing



### Normative ethics: almost infinite-time preference leximin-rule well-being utilitarianism

Maybe game-theory and Kantian equilibrium.


### Metaethics: Probability distribution and uncertainty over different normative systems and even moral anti-realism.


### Ramsey's Intergenerational welfare economics

A case for increasing life-span. Longer life-span means more long-term happiness
$\int_0^T f(x) dx > \int_0^{T'} f(x) dx$

Whenever $T>T'$. 



### Cybernetic (or even Chaoplexic) economics


### Post-Keynesian economics maybe?
### Agents and Rational agents, methodological individualism vs holism





### On the superiority of autistic thought patterns (more of a joke chapter to get people's attention)

The entire book likely demonstrates a thoroughly autistic way of thinking. It is the case that autists are generally less persuaded by arguments via emotional appeals and more towards it's logical validity (source) and they focus on actually interesting mathematical patterns rather than human faces (source). 

The struggle of an autistic writer is communication faults with neurotypicals. It can be easy to mess up one's communication ability with them if writing isn't clear enough, or if it violates arbitrary writing norms. In either case, the struggle is not a major one. 




### Finding Utopia

Value function V
A utopian world $w$ is a world such that $V(w)>a$ for some utopian threshold $a$ 

Limiting the search range of possible worlds: Assume physicalism is true, i.e worlds that do not follow the laws of physics are worlds which are impossible, or atleast outside of some accessibility relation $R_{phys}$. 

Assuming the universe is finite (and therefore a finite amount of energy) and a thermodynamically closed system, by the second law of thermodynamics this finite amount of energy will eventually reach a statistically very likely situation of being completely homogeneous across the universe. We limit worlds to ones with a finite energy amount $E$. Then, utilizing $E$ seems to be a convergent instrumental goal for many value functions $V$. 







### Power and Power structures

Defined game-theoretically as the ability to control payouts. 

This implies that most neoclassical theorems are false.

AIs will likely not reason neoclassically as a consequence. 

Include that mathematical theory of forward-responsibility and graph-theoretic responsibility, information and decision structures. Game theory between individual agents. Multiple such graphs interacting with eachother, game theoretically. Or just individual nodes? Methodological Individualism vs Holism. 


### Dictatorship is bad

Most real life dictatorships are actually oligarchies, given the social choice theoretic definition. 

Given our definition of instrumental rationality, unless you are the dictator, unless you have moral constraints, it seems as if dictatorship is negative for goal attainment. 

The real debate is between Epistocracy and Democracy. Jury's theorems states that if individuals who vote have a < 50% chance to be correct, then the aggregate vote goes towards being completely wrong in the limit as you go towards an infinite number of voters. One way to avoid this is to restrict voting rights to people who are often wrong. This is the main idea of Epistocracy. This chapter will deal with this and some contemporary debates on the issue.
