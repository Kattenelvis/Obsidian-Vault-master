I don't care much about aesthetics so my takes will be bad but I will sure try.


I'm an experientialist-hedonist when it comes to art. If something feels/looks/tastes/sounds good, then it follows that it is good. The causal process of creating  the art piece has no bearing on whether it feels good or not. This means amateur artists, professional artists, animals, children, computer generated, AI art e.t.c are all equally good if it produces the same outcome. Exception being if the experiencer has a specific belief which brings down or up how good the art feels. Someone who claims animals or AI art isn't good, when presented with art made by those they believe to be made by a professional artist human, might believe that it is good art.

There exist statistical patterns where certain flavour combinations, visual structures, chord progression e.t.c feel better among human populations. This can make it appear somewhat objective. But it isn't.
