Maybe replace "democratic" with "episteocratic", and "cybernetic-planning" with "market".

Chapter 6 in that book uhhh knowledge, belief and action has a mathematical definition of a hierarchy which includes information flows and responsibility flows. 



The state as having the final goal of aggregating social welfare functionals. These are determined through votings, which would sortoff become the instrumental goals. 

Scientific methods can then apply to how policies will be actually implemented to achieve the final ends that the social welfare functional aggregate demands. However, people can start votes to implement rules (such as obligations and forbiddens) which prevent the state from taking certain actions that we deem unacceptable. This might be one way to align dumber-than-human AI systems aswel. 




Incommensurable values can be formalised as multiple utility functions $\{U_1,\dots U_n\}$. A maximiser algorithm calculates all possible state of affairs and then takes the strongly dominant outcome if it exist $\{U_1(p),\dots,U_n(p)\}$ such that $U_i(q)\leq U_i(p)$ for all values $U_i$. If it doesn't exist, then screw you! Jk, we can use social choice theory! By certain representation theorems, the utility functions represent some preference relation. So each $U_i$ is associated with it's own preference relation $R_i$. So we can perform similar social aggregation functions as found in social choice theory on these incommensurable values.   

Satisfaction algorithms are also possible, where one searches the space of possible states of affairs and selects the first one where $U_i > c_i$ for all constants $c_i$ associated as the minimum accepted degree that $U_i$ is allowed to be. 

Open question: Are superintelligent AGI's likely to end up as maximisers even if they begin as satisficers?

I will begin with analyzing the two preference relations typically associated by objective list utilitarianism (happiness and knowledge) by calculating the condorcet winner directly for the preference relations. The domain of possible states will include "ignorance is bliss" scenarios. 

Let's do a basic test example. Knowing $p$ (symbolized as $Kp$) leads to less happiness
Here are all possible states:
$\{Kp, Kq\}$
$\{Kq\}$
$\{Kp\}$
$\{\}$

Then we see that according to the relation for happiness, these are some examples:
$\{Kq\} \succ_h \{Kq, Kp\}$
$\{Kp\} \sim_h \{Kq, Kq\}$
$\{\} \sim_h \{Kq\}$
$\{\} \succ_h \{Kp\}$

And for the knowledge operator, it's just whenever there's more things in the set the better.

So we have incommensurability in the following relation:
$\{Kq\} \succ_h \{Kq, Kp\}$
$\{Kq\} \prec_k \{Kq, Kp\}$

But the condorcet winner is the following:

$\{K_q\}$ will always be ranked above $\{\}$ in a 1v1 battle. 
$\{K_q\}$ 

Fuck I'm realizing now it's a tie between $\{K_q, K_p\}$ and $\{K_q\}$.
