## The rationality of Stoicism

While stoicism in ancient Greece was an encompassing belief system involving logic, metaphysics and ethics, we will only focus on the decision theoretic aspect of their ethics. 

Take time to have the following properties relevant for decision theory:

1. We cannot take actions that affects the past
2. Regret over a, even if its rational regret, is unable to change a.
3. 



## The rationality of Buddhism

A set of $n$ desires $D = \{d_1,\dots d_n\}$. 
Some subset $S\subseteq D$ are satisfied desires. 
Desires can be second order, for example: $d_1(\neg d_2)$ (desire to not have a desire). 

Desire satisfaction accounts of happiness/preference take it that the more desires is satisfied, the happier one is. This means that if $|S_1| > |S_2|$ then being in state $S_2$ is preferable to $S_1$. 

However, what if having more desires is bad?

The Buddhist hypothesis: If the ratio $|S_1|/|D_1| > |S_2|/|D_2|$, then being in state $S_1$ and $D_1$ is happier.

When Buddha sat on the tree, and had the desire to eat, he also had the desire to not desire to eat. However he eventually gave in, and realized enlightenment that him chasing to not having desires is a desire itself.
