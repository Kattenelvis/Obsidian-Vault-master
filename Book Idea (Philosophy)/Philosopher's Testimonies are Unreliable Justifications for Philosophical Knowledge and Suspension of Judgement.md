Some may argue the following argument is sound:

(1) If some group of people have knowledge of arguments for and against certain propositions $\{p_1,\dots p_n\}$, then their testimony regarding $\{p_1,\dots p_n\}$ is reliable.

(2) Philosophers have, through years of practice, knowledge of most if not all currently known (by humanity) arguments for and against philosophical propositions.

(C) Philosophical testimony is reliable 

In this article I will argue against (2)


## The most common Methodology is false

Intuition based philosophy is wrong, yet very commonly practiced. 
- Tacit Theory
- Language learning
- Bring up
- Explicit Theory

## Experimental philosophy 


There have been interesting findings in recent decades in experimental philosopher regarding how for instance, personality and cultural upbringing, are strong indicators

- Personality traits
- Culturally relative
- Individually relative

Studies  found that Gettier cases are seen as knowledge in east asian cultures.[source] Aswell as putnam reference differences. 

For instance, in one study [source] personality traits of extroverts (extravertedness in the big-5) were correlated with belief in libertarian free will. This correlation was not weakened for individuals more knowledgeable in the field.  

- Ethicists are as ethical as their friend group

It's quite incoherent to take actions that violates moral truths, when one is justified and motivated by moral truths. In that case, maybe they're not so motivating after all?

## Philosophers overspecialize

There can exist, and do in fact exist, many philosophical arguments whose premises tend to be conclusions in arguments from multiple fields of philosophy. A single argument may have premises from what can be considered metaphysics, epistemology, mind, mathematics, logic and so on. All of them will be guaranteed to have atleast one premise from logic, which will be the inference rules that will be applied to premises to generate conclusions. Often times, and as any naturalist philosophers believes, many of these premmises (perhaps almost all) should be emperical. So this requires being good at physics, chemistry, biology, economics etc. which is an unreasonable demand to put on one individual. 

At the same time, philosophers are over-specialists in a lot of ways. There are of course the occasional Quine's and Davidson's who are "renaissance philosophers", but these are rare in modern academia. In science, this happened aswell, and as a consequence we've had a rise of interdisciplinary research since then. But philosophers generally seem to write papers on their own, or with most one or two more collaborators in the same field. As such, their conclusion might draw from a false premise that might've been spotted from including a more diverse crew of paper writers. 

So I support an increase in interdisciplinary research where philosophers and scientists are more involved together, and philosophers of different fields. As such, while their arguments may be valid, they may not be sound.

## Philosophers are bad at science

Philosophers are generally, though not always bad at science
- Physics (What is QM?)
- Cog Sci (Mental representations?)
- Chemistry (Water is not h2o)

In that book, Ladyman goes over a depressing amount of examples on how major philosophers have massively missinterpreted science, particularly quantum mechanics and general relativity. 

## Conclusion
Philosopher's Testimonies are Unreliable Justifications for Philosophical Knowledge and Suspension of Judgement

One should instead always go by the arguments themselves, and not argue that philosophers X argue another way, nor bring up the numbers such as [philpapers survey] to support your point. 

Instead one should take arguments at face value and judge them according to their merit only.
