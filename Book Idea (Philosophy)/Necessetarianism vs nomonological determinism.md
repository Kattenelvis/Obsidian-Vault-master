Two types of fatalism, necessetarianism and natural law determinism, are discussed. 

Necessetarianism: There exists only one possible world, which is the actual world.
1. $p \rightarrow \square p$

Deterministic Natural laws: Updates the state of the universe over time based on unchaning rules. Let $U_t$ be the state of the universe at time $t$:
1. Discrete: $f(U_t) = U_{t+1}$
2. Continuous: $f(t) = U_t$

 With some initial condition (the initial state of the universe) $U_0$. It is deterministic because $\square (f(U_t) = U_{t+1})$.

Thesis 1: Deterministic natural laws do not imply necessetarianism since the initial conditions and natural laws could still have been different. 
$f(U_t) = U_{t+1} \nrightarrow \square (f(U_t) = U_{t+1})$

Likewise, necessetarianism does not imply natural law determinism. The state of the universe at every time step could have been designed by an subject with free actions, or it is neccessarily the case that the 


There's no experiment to determine whether or not each pixel is updated individually without it being in the function to use other pixels vs a whole universal update function or anything inbetween.


The discussion whetether info about black holes constitutes a part of our theory is an interesting question, and can be answered using the theory that has been developed in this chapter as follows:
Initial conditions are a part of the theory of everything. To determine $S_{t}$ you need $S_{t-1}$ aswell as the updating rules. If the function is reversible, then any timepoint is needed (like say, right now). Otherwise you need $S_0$.
