Everyone needs one of these these days!



# Preparing for Artificial General Intelligence


## Universal basic income
Give every citizen a basic income to survive on

## Economic Restructuring
Too much is owned by too few. 



# Preparing for Longevity and Enhancments

People will live longer

# Preparing for Space Colonization

Establishment of space laws






Improving Earth now:

1. Global cooperation structure
	1. UN at the level of the EU, global parliament where everyone on earth can vote.
	2. Ensures less degree of defecting on some global areas.
	3. Global focus, global integration, world priorities research.
	4. Integrating institutions globally. 
	5. Ensure laws don't lead to unintended consequences. 
	6. Strict scientific analysis of consequences of laws. Perhaps with prediction markets. 
2. Healthcare
	1. Science is to shift from extending end-of-life and towards extending healthy life years. 
	2. Shift towards addressing health factors on a more fundamental level such as stress and pollutants.  
	3. 1% of GDP should go to longevity research.
	4. Ensure safe and effective malaria medication
	5. Free or very cheap primary healthcare, universal health coverage.
	6. Free toothcare. 
	7. Mental health reform, get rid or radically reform mental institutions. Destigmatize mental health, reform on therapy. Mental health focus. 
	8. Sexual education, minimize STDs.
	9. Boost technology and AI implementation into the healthcare sector.
	10. Disabilities support. Give payments more readily (or have UBI).
	11. Prevent lab leaks of viruses. 
3. Education
	1. Education for free, including kindergarten and university. Finland as a model of education.
	2. Education in age of AI: AI assistants, aimed and directed education.
	3. Education based on interests and less job focus.
	4. End bullying and discrimination, in all directions (students to students, students to teachers, teachers to students, teachers to teachers).
	5. Education is fully secularized, i.e no religion in science courses. 
4. Environment
	1. Clean air project: Ensure everywhere humans live there is clean air.
	2. Clean water project: Same but for water.
	3. Cap-n-Trade, carbon credits, carbon taxes. 
	4. Global natural parks system (Amazon rainforest etc.). Wildlife conservation. Ocean conservation. Global environmental science network. 
	5. Sustainable forestry, restriction or banning of rainforest cutting. 
	6. Net-0 carbon emissions, push below 2C climate change mark. 
	7. End of landfills, full on recycling and biofuels.
5. Technology
	1. Cautious techno-optimism. We might die because of new technology, but it's more likely going to be to the benefit of all, as we approximate full-body simulations.
	2. Move towards preparing for a world with human-level intelligences. Prevent both misalignment X-risk and power-seeking behavior in institutions. Ensure global mankind utopian abundance with a post-AGI world. Perhaps about 2-3% of GDP on AI and AI safety. Safety inspections on frontier models.
	3. Space exploration and colonization, up to 1-2% of GDP.
	4. Fully immersive VR.
	5. Connected world with Wi-Fi.
6. Wealth
	1. Redistribute wealth. Global taxes, end of tax cheating and avoidance on islands. 
7. Households
	1. Replace gas, oil heating with electric or geothermal heating. 
8. Work
	1. High standards of worker safety.
	2. Eventually move towards 100% unemployment under full automation in ways that benefit everyone.
	3. Universal basic income. 
9. Law system
	1. Fair and just blah blah you get the point.
	2. Legal realism, more of use of probability theory?
10. Services
	1. 
11. Infrastructure
	1. Global interconnected high-speed train system, to replace airplanes.
	2. Space elevators?
12. Industry
	1. Global decarbonization of industry.
	2. Introduction and tests of Allende era cybernetic planning or similar. Computational planning tools
13. Exports-Imports
	1. Planning?
14. Food
	1. Global food project: Ensure everyone has enough food to survive
	2. Healthy food project: Ensure food is healthy and up to standard. Diminishment of heavily processed or poisonous food, food regulation. Sugar taxes?
15. Electricity
	1. Rapid replacement of coal, oil, gas power and heating to either electrical, biogas or (preferably) reducing production/energy use.
	2. Rapid expansion of Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Water and other promising renewable energy sources
	3. Expansion of nuclear power. Testing of new experimental kinds of power (thorium, fusion etc.)
	4. Smartgrids and energy storage. Global energy grid connection and cooperation. 
16. City Planning
	1. Constructing or reconstructing cities to be walkable with massive public transport funding. 
	2. Limit suburban growth, city sprawl limits.
	3. Archologies?
	4. Large green zones, city parks. 
	5. Every city a functioning sewage system.
17. Rights
	1. LGBTQ+ rights enshrined everywhere. 
	2. Rights of other minorities. 
18. Safety
	1. Abolishment of standing armies, the draft, globally. 
19. Population ethics.
	1. Genetic engineering on preferable genes for the next generation. 
	2. Given the greatly increased standard of living we want to achieve while achieving climate goals, decreased population. 
20. Non-Human animals
	1. End meat and dairy subsidies.
	2. End factory farming. Shrimp health project.
	3. Focus on new protein sources.
