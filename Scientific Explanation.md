Explicit definitions 

"An explicit definition gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing, event, state, process or property to be an instance of the term defined. For example: “triangle” is explicitly defined as “plane figure having three sides.” Since the conditions are together sufficient we know that everything that satisfies them all is a Euclidean triangle and since the conditions are individually necessary, we know if just one is not satisfied by an item, it is not a Euclidean triangle. The beauty of such definitions is that they remove any vagueness, and provide maximally precise definitions"

Explanans and explanandum. The ideal gas law explains the movement of a certain gas. 

Scientific laws, are they explanatory. Necessary and universal.  No causality mentioned in the laws of physics. 

Initial conditions/Boundary conditions 



The logical positivists tried to logically justify explanans and explanandum in the same way they do in mathematics. 
X : X is =df --------
Might work in mathematics
2 : 2 is =df third member of the natural numbers
With logical closure in the logical system it is defined in. The analytic-synthetic distinction would then imply that internal questions of definition ?!

"Only by invoking laws could explanations identify the objective relationship between explanans and explanandum"

NM-model 
For the explanans to successfully explain the explanandum several conditions must be met. First, “the explanandum must be a logical consequence of the explanans” and “the sentences constituting the explanans must be true” (Hempel 1948 [1965: 248]) That is, the explanation should take the form of a sound deductive argument in which the explanandum follows as a conclusion from the premises in the explanans. This is the “deductive” component of the model. Second, the explanans must contain at least one “law of nature” and this must be an _essential_ premise in the derivation in the sense that the derivation of the explanandum would not be valid if this premise were removed. This is the “nomological” component of the model—“nomological” being a philosophical term of art which, suppressing some niceties, means (roughly) “lawful”.

Weaknening the nomonoloigcal part by not having it be the law itself (since it requires universal confirmation accross all time and space and situations which is impossible) but our best guesses for the law. Problems due to disagreement of what those best laws are.

Also, physicists have much larger degree of agreement than social scientists, if you exclude theories that combine QM and GR aswell as interpretations of QM and cosmology models and different formalizations of GR and different formalism of classical mechanics......uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. EVEN QED IS FUCKING EPICYCLES APPARENTLY NOW!!!

"Progress in the philosophy of science has often consisted in the construction of counterexamples to analyses, definitions, or explications, and then revisions of the definition to accommodate the counterexamples"
This makes defining objects in philosophy an form of inductive reasoning. 
"... $X$ ... =$_{df}$ $\phi(X)$"
For explanans left side and explanandum to the right.

No counterexample has been found yet, 
"$\neg\phi(A)$"

Therefore we won't continue using counterexamples. Verification criterion on definitions!? Relies too much on intuition. 

Clearly the solution is to make it probabilistic rather than deductive. 

"$X$ is the case/boundary condition/initial condition"
"Every time $X$ has happened before, $Y$ has happened"
"Therefore it is likely for Y to happen now aswel."

Given n experiments, then the probability will be 
$P(X|n) = P(n|X)P(X)/P(n)$


NM explanations also doesn't take teleology into account? According to the Flag Pole example

"This argument is supposed to show that explanation is not merely a matter of logic and meaning (syntax and semantics), but is as much a matter of “pragmatics” (that dimension of language which reflects the practical circumstances in which we put it to use). We may contrast three different aspects of a language:  its syntax, which includes the rules of logic as well as grammar; its semantics, the meanings of its words; and its pragmatics, which includes the conditions that make some statements appropriate or meaningful."
That's were you get the theories of utterances and speech-acts aswell as pragmatic theories of the structure of scientific theories.


Do theories even need universal quantifiers at all? (From Salmons book 4 decades of SE)



Second order explanation: The explanandum can be an hypothesis itself! So a second order hypothesis can derive other hypothesises which in turn derive observation propositions which can falsify first order hypothesises which could then falsify the second order one.
