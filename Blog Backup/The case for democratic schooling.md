_I hated school._

When I graduated high school, I did not really feel that accomplished. I felt ok, to have completed something that's a societal norm to complete. But rarely did I find school to be particularly good or interesting. Maybe just three or so classes really changed me. I had many feuds with my teachers, complained and criticized the educational system for many years. Not just in a whiny "I don't wanna do this", but in a general sense of feeling of injustice that permuted the whole system. I found arbitrary rules and broke them constantly, I would not be subjugated by arbitrary rules! If I lived in a place that enforced school costumes then I would refuse to wear them. But my frustrations were not unanswered. One of my teachers in high school suggested "[Summerhill school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhill_School)", a different type of schooling. And that school seemed to be close to what I wanted, democracy.

In a democratic schooling system, children are allowed to attend as many or as few classes as they want, they can explore subjects for themselves without being forced to do anything they don't want too. Students who dislike mathematics might choose not do math, until they discover their love for physics and suddenly realizes the immense utility of mathematics. Someone might despise literature, and instead of forcing the student to do literature one can wait until the student is more mature to do it rather than forcing it down the students brain.

_Zindri: This is merely a farce, a child shall learn everything necessary for adult life and go outside their interest zone_.

Zandra: I don't think the point of most schooling should be to prepare for ones adult life, nor is that the case at the moment. That still doesn't mean the classes should be mandatory, but rather the students should be allowed to desire to learn important life skills through sheer self-motivation, not forcing it into the brain through compulsion and force_.  
_  
Zindri: But then we will have people who don't understand how to evaluate statistics, think critically or basic home economics_.  
_  
Zandra: As if normal schooling facilitates these things? A lot of people misunderstand statistics all the time or doesn't look critically at it. Basic home economics is barely taught. And even then, if these skills are so important, then the importance itself should be enough of a motivator for pupils in a democratic system._

_Zindri: But then no student would want to learn about anything! No student would want to do any courses then! How would anyone learn?_

_Zandra: You fail to take into account that by allowing students to choose courses, then teachers must necessarily make their courses interesting and useful. You also fail to take into account that curiosity is something almost everyone is born with, human nature so to speak. School has done a fantastic job at getting rid of this curiosity, such that it seems determined that no students would ever enjoy schooling._

The fact of the matter is that the current school system has its origins in nationalistic indoctrination from Prussia. The soldiers would often abandon the military since they could think too much for themselves. So they established educational institutions that would teach numeracy, german and of course, "history", which would be pro-Prussian indoctrination. Strict hierarchies with strictly enforced rules combined with a regime, a daily routine which would resemble that of the rapidly growing industry floor. The schools main purpose was however to make people follow orders, to be complicit and to obey authority for their teacher/nation rather than be a free individual. While schooling has since liberalized in most countries, some of these old sentiments in them still remain.

A democratic form of schooling would solve these problems by giving students the freedom and ability to think for themselves, set their own goals and priorities and don't let their mind be given to a hierarchical institution. This will insure good individuals with healthy and free minds. The principal would the pupils and the teachers. By that I mean that there should be no principal at all. There would be no arbitrary rules, a pupil shall be able to do as they please as long as one doesn't infringe on the rights of others.

Another upside to democratic school is that it takes away the trouble of creating a rigid curriculum, teachers will have the ability to design their own curriculum in order to attract students who can at will determine if they wanna go to that class or not. Grades shouldn't be death sentences, if they even would exist at all in such a system.

A practical way of doing this could be through a liquid democratic system, which is just like a direct democracy system were students and teachers can delegate their vote to someone else if they don't want to vote on policy themselves. This can be done online.

One fact is clear, the current education system does not free people to be individual thinkers but to follow strict orders, schedules and curricula. This shall not be the case in the future were people would be allowed to have democratic control over their lives. Were people can determine their interests instead of being forced to something. Were people have the right for a good education.
