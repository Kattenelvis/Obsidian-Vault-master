In this post I will sketch a basic overview of the construction of a formal system which contains self-referential sense-data symbols, which we will call "The logic of Self-referential sense-data symbols" or SRSD for short. While in principle definable without utilizing translations into natural language, it will be used here, purely used for pedagogical purposes and to demonstrate its translations into English. We will use $latex =_T$ to mean "identical after applying a translation".

ðŸŸ¥ $latex ={T}$ "Red region in visual space, square shaped" ðŸŸ¦ $latex ={T}$ "Blue region in visual space, square shaped"

As we can see, the symbols are self referential, in the fact that they denote themselves. We continue with multiple such symbols.

ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦ $latex =_T$ "Red region in visual space to the left of a blue region in visual space"

We could extend this to one's entire visual space. Here's an example from integrated information theory of an individual who drew his entire visual space at one point in time:

We can also talk of symbols that change over time, such as this one:

$latex =_T$ "Rectangle region of visual space shifting between red and blue over time"

Which is thus a self-referential and formal description of David Chalmer's "[dancing qualia](https://consc.net/papers/qualia.html)". Chalmers entire article deserves a formalization in logic.

It's worth noting this system extends into sounds aswell. I was unable to get the audio file to work on wordpress, so consult this youtube video: [https://youtu.be/X0qMxoUncgw](https://youtu.be/X0qMxoUncgw) $latex =_T$ 520hz x db (decibel here is a variable depending on your volume etc.)

Note that we can expand this symbolic system up to one's own phenomenal consciousness at any given timestep. While I'd love to also give some examples of smells, tastes, proprioception etc. this is sadly the limit of current technology.

The idea is to utilize SRSD to formulate the dynamics of multiple phenomenal consciousnesses which are inaccessible to each other (for instance, what seems to be the case between two humans, barring radical overlap). We can thus in principle describe say the experience of Billy at $latex t$ and Alice at time $latex t$ using this symbolic language. This allows us to extend the language into other important areas of the philosophy of mind, such as fusions and fissions (so two symbols become one or vice versa respectively), overlapping minds, inverse qualia (color symbols are swapped), dancing qualia (already described earlier) and objective frequency as an interpretation of probability (so for instance, ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ¦ ðŸŸ¦ gives us a frequency of 4/5:th blue and 1/5:th red, we could thus interpret some probability space $latex P as the probability of randomly pointing at some part of visual space)

An important limitation worth mentioning is that SRSD might not be able to express qualia-substrate pairs for it cannot express substrates (since it's not able to express external-world objects beyond experience).

This is only a sketch of such a system. It's slightly different from the set-theoretic version of phenomenal consciousness in my two articles [Formal Phenomenology](https://thephilosophyaddict.wordpress.com/2023/11/25/formal-phenomenology/) and [Phenomenalist Ontology and Mereology](https://thephilosophyaddict.wordpress.com/2024/08/02/phenomenalist-ontology-and-mereology-with-connections-to-physics/) (where this article is more like the first article, giving a sketch. Phenomenalist ontology and mereology builds a fully formal system). The overall concept is quite similar: formalizing phenomenal consciousness in a formal system, but the systems seem to differ significantly from eachother (there may of course turn out to be similarities in some way that hasn't been mathematically proven yet).

SRSD is inspired by Carnap's Aufbau, which I respect as one of the greatest philosophical projects of all time. We should strive towards a new formal logic system of phenomenal consciousness. I think it seems fairly likely that all concepts can be built up from the phenomenal concepts in SRSD, thus we could in principle have a self-contained philosophical system within SRSD that builds on the phenomenal concepts as fundamental. The idea is that all concepts terminate in descriptions of set data or a set of descriptions of sense data. Concepts that exist in circularity or in some holistic sense are meaningless. This entails all [mental content is internalist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenal-intentionality/), which I'm fine with. We may be able to show that the systems expressive power is below that of Heyting Arithmetic, and thus can hold its own truth predicate and is provably complete and consistent.

Some final notes. Wittgenstein's private language argument does not hold here, for the correctness conditions are trivially satisfied. I also don't think Quine's translatability skepticism is of any importance either.
