While anarchists critique the existence of all coercive hierarchies, an-caps hold the belief that the government is the only coercive institution in existence. An-caps believe in sacred beings such as corporations, private property, humanity and more, putting such things above their own rational self interest. (Note: not all an-caps are for corporations, and realize it's a statist construct).

### **1. Introduction**

Being opposed to landlords and bosses usually gets you struck down as a "statist" or "commie" by an-caps. They instantly assume you want to go full Maoist on landlords and bosses, completely straw-manning the opposition with ad-hominem.

Usually this has to do with their absolutist views on property rights, which I will try to debunk in this post.

##### **1.1 Definitions****:**

**Private property** - A private individual owning or joint ownership a plot of land or means of production. I am not including forms of personally property in here (which is what you're able to defend as your own). Private Property can be voluntarily traded or gifted, and the owner can do whatever they desire with it.  
**Coercion** - Being forced to something against your will.  
**An-cap** - Anarcho-Capitalist. An individual who identifies with the anarcho-capitalist ideology  
**Contract/Agreement** - Orally or written voluntary exchange of goods, services, deeds and more. Sometimes informal, usually formal.

### **2. Private property as a statist construct**

Modern private property law originates from 1600s Britain during the enclosure movement. Small farms were enclosed into larger farms. The elite convinced the British government to take land and sell it back to the elites for a very low price.

Property that used to be owned by many people in common, was now owned by just a single person or jointly owned by a "corporation", as corporate law started to evolve later on. People had to either choose to work in a factory, or to become homeless, as they were thrown off their ancestral lands. Many people wanted to continue the farming lifestyle, but weren't allowed to by the government and it's unjust private property rights. The elite now started to control and own more parts of people's lives.

Anarchism started to become a large force by the mid-late 1800s as a reaction to this ever encroaching government-backed capitalism. The property of the rich was defended by the police, and if the police was insufficient then the army would be called in. Small workshops and co-ops were displaced or were considered "uncompetitive" when they had to compete to the private owners who benefited from the majority of government policy. Many were forced to work extremely long shifts in unforgiving and extremely unsafe work.

Working before all of this occurred was obviously not flowers and rainbows, working at a farm is hardly easier than a factory. But the early days of the industrial age were certainty worse for people's mental and physical health than the farm life before.

##### **2.1 "But you own yourself, you are the private property of yourself. Therefore you control your own labor, and when mixed with nature you now own that thing."**

This argument is mostly true. However the notion that you "own" yourself rather than "being" yourself is problematic. You have to choose one or the other, and there are certain facts about them that you need to accept in order to be logically consistent:

##### **2.1.1 If you are private property: You can sell yourself**

An-cap private property rights allows you to do whatever you want to do with your private property, including destroying, modifying, renting and selling it. If you are the property of yourself, then you are allowed, by an-cap logic, to sell yourself.

Now the Rothbardians might reject this, but why? Why can't you sell yourself? If you are the property of yourself, why can't you sell yourself? Huh? Statist? Do you wanna impose restrictions against slavery? Or do you accept that you're actually yourself, and not the property of another? Well...

##### **2.1.2 If you are yourself: You can't rent yourself out  
**

Consider that you are yourself instead of being the private property of yourself. You have your self and your rational self interest. You are an autonomous individual, who does not need anyone above to be commanded by, or below to command. Now, selling yourself would be immoral, as you loose that autonomy and you're subjugating yourself to a power relationship with a master and a slave. You're no longer yourself.

But this applies to renting out yourself too. Having a job were you're applying labor, a person at the top gets the profit and then gives you a small amount back, is immoral by this principle. You're robbed of your humanity, autonomy, and you're no longer yourself. You'd be much better off by managing the factory/office as a union of egoists (such as a workers co-op), as a way to defend it, share salaries and decide on how it should be run.

And the second part of the argument enforced the critique on bosses. Under capitalism you do not own the product of your labor, it's owned by the employer. He/she then decides how much money you should make, much less than what the worth of that product is. So even though _you_ are using _your_Â labor to make the product, it's the _employer_ who reaps the benefits, and then gives you a salary for it.

### **3. Landlords and Bosses: Privileged elite by the government decree  
**

The people who own most things in society, the privileged elite, only does so by government decree. An-caps argue that (some, most or even all of) these people somehow "earned" or "deserved" this property, and that the modern day distribution of private property is based on libertarian ethics. But this is obviously not the case.

##### **3.1 "But that's corporatocracy, not capitalism!"**

An-caps (aswell as libertarians, capitalist conservatives and some neoliberals) like to use this rhetoric as a way to claim that all problems are caused by too _little_ capitalism (except for the neoliberals who see laws against bribing as the solution). In their eyes, the government is too big, so therefore capitalists have too much power to control and dictate. They bribe, hire lobbyists and do acts of "crony capitalism".

But an-caps only ever blame one side of this crime: The government. But the capitalist elite plays just as big of a role. Who is doing the bribing? Who is hiring lobbyists? Both sides are being immoral, yet you're only saying one side is wrong?

Another issue here is that capitalists always find ways to increase their power. Removing the state without capitalism would lead to an instant creation of a new government to serve their interest, to protect their wealth and private property. The state might grow quickly, or slowly, but eventually it would just become the current system as the wealthy elites want a government created. Even keeping the state as the libertarians and conservatives do, it would defiantly lead to the same outcome eventually.

As stated earlier, modern capitalism is founded on statist creeds. The stock market, money printing, policing, the military, courts and legal corporations are all enforced by the state. An-caps would argue that this is wrong and immoral, but fail to realize that without these things you wouldn't have capitalism. Why would (some, not all) an-caps go to attack against these things, and then fifteen minutes later go to defending the CEO of a large corporation? Corporations and other large hierarchal structures can't persist without government protection, so why defend Soros, Bezos or Musk?

If the government protection of private property, the legal corporation and intellectual property e.t.c ended tomorrow (or was slowly phased out), what would happen? Would the bosses and landlords somehow be able to hold it together? Would the huge, hierarchal, bulky, bureaucratic and centralized corporate structures simply collapse into efficient networks of decentralized production units, each co-coordinating with others? With worker owned businesses, worker co-ops and similar, flat structures. Wouldn't that be a better world? With more meaningful work?

Or you could do some mental gymnastics and claim worker ownership of the means of production is somehow capitalism, but I rest my case.

##### **3.2 "Oppressed by nature/No one is forcing you not to work."**

One argument that sometimes comes up is this: You need to work to get food, because that's how nature is, it's not like animals or primitive humans just sat down and food started to pour down from the sky, until the capitalists started to restrict it and forced us to work for it.

And this might seem like a valid argument, nature demands we hunt for food. However with current, industrial farming, there's more than enough food for everyone! Everyone can have their culinary needs met with today technology. Food is rotting in the shops and restaurants while people who can't afford it starve on the street.

Everyone could have their food needs met, but they aren't because of capitalism and private property. Choosing to not work will probably lead to starvation, and it's therefore coercive and forceful.

##### **3.3 "But it's a voluntary agreement/contract"**

The word Voluntary tends to come up often among an-caps and voluntaryists(a type of an-cap). If you dare questioning it, you're pointed out a statist for "wanting to impose restrictions". The problem is just, how do you wanna impose the agreements in the first place? A person with a stick? The people's stick? Or a corporate stick? Sticky situation I say.

A problem with the argument is that it assumes you can argue in favor of "voluntary agreements", that no voluntaryist agree is just or fair. Plenty of such contracts are signed today, and deregulating it while keeping everything else would be an absolute disaster. (Note, before you call me a "statist", I am not pro-regulation, but they are a somewhat-necessary evil while we still live under capitalism).

An example of such an voluntary agreement would be a rest-of-life servitude contract. It could look something like this:

_"I herby declare myself a servant to Mr Anderson for the rest of my living life. Everything that I own will be inherited by Mr Anderson, I will always do what Mr Anderson says. Any disputes will be solved in a private court under Judge X  
Signed: Mr Anderson, Me__"_

Considering all of the wonderful and magical potential contracts that an-caps can always seem cook up, it is by no means a "straw-man" or "unlikely event", or they would have to give up on their stuff aswell.

##### **3.4 "But no one would agree to such an contract"**

A lot of people live in impoverished conditions, can be deprived of their senses somewhat using drugs or alcohol, thinks it's a great opportunity for them in the moment, sexual kink or any other number of reasons anyone would want/be coerced into being a servant to someone else.

The person signing this contract could be an impoverished teen in an abusive family, and see it as the only means for they to escape. Mr Anderson is _exploiting_ their terrible situation. "Muh exploitation", an-caps might say. But it's completely true. I guess they just don't wanna accept it.

#### **Conclusion**:

Private Property is a statist concept originating from 1600s Britain. Modern capitalism as a whole was founded by government creed. Capitalism and the state is inherently oppressive and coercive. Landlords and bosses exists due to the government and needs to be gotten rid off. Calling it "corporatocracy" is dumb, because capitalism requires the state to function. Many voluntary agreements are really not, and are really coercive and exploitative.

For a true world of voluntary collaboration, capitalism and the state needs to be dismantled.
