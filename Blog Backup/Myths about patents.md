When arguing against patents, many people are quick to defend something that actively harms them. But think about it, when was the last time you bought a far too expensive medicine, or were forced to buy a new printer because the ink cartridges are excessively expensive? When was the last time you wished you could only order cheap spare parts for your car or mobile?

The fact that you are unable to perform the above is simply due to patents, as no other person has permission from Your Majesty to copy, modify or sell color cartridges, car engines and mobile phones other than the "inventors". Of course, those who retain patents are very rarely the engineers or researchers, but rather the employer or corporation.

But various people quickly come up with counter-arguments to defend their beloved CEOs and "entrepreneurs". Below, I will try to answer a few arguments you hear often.

**1. "Patents are an incentive for research."**

In a meta-study [1], they show one study from 1986 where the researchers ask a hundred companies in twelve industries about how large a proportion of their research and development between 1981-83 would not have taken place if they had not been able to benefit from patents.

The results show that the majority of industries such as cars, textiles, instruments, electronics, rubber, metals and machinery are barely affected by patents. Many of the people in those industries even believe that patents have had a detrimental effect on research and development.

Patents are also one of the least effective strategies for bringing a product to market:

> _"Patents were reported to be the least effective mechanism of appropriation for new processes, with secrecy being the most effective. Product patents were reported to be relatively more effective, although less so than several other strategies such as lead time and sales or service efforts."_

Only the pharmaceutical industry and a bit of the chemical industry believe that they benefit from patents. This may be because, according to the researchers, molecules are easy to distinguish so it becomes easier and less risky to detect and attack patent infringement.

> _"Across industries, all three surveys documented evidence that on average firms report that patents have limited effectiveness as an appropriation mechanism relative to other levers such as lead time and trade secrecy, but that in a few industries – namely, chemicals and pharmaceuticals – firms report that patents are essential for spurring R&D investments."_

But that does not mean that medicine companies are without problems. Patents in the industry can lead to situations like when Martin Shkreli increased the price of different types of medicines 50 times. [2] Without competition, medicines can have much higher prices than the market value, which means that poor people find it much more difficult to afford medicines.

**2. "It is ethical because the researcher can make money from their invention"**

Who actually owns and profits from patenting in today's system? It is very rare for researchers, as they have rented themselves out to a "company", whose then steals their inventions. There is not much of a choice, as the majority of labs are locked behind private property. If a researcher were to quit their job, they would not keep their inventions, they did not own it at all, it is the "company" that owns the patents.

Sure, it might be romantic to imagine a poor old inventor working and toiling in his garage and then making a huge invention that he then patents and becomes a millionaire on. But in today's society this is only a fantasy. Maybe this used to work before simple things were invented, but it's hardly how it works today. And if it does happen, companies often buy up the patents for an extremely low price and earn a lot of money on it, without the researcher being able to gain anything from it.

Almost all active patents are owned by major companies [3] and not by the researchers who invented them. IBM, Google, Canon, LG, Toshiba and Sony, among others, own the majority of patents. Only the oligarchs have permission from Your Majesty.

**3. "Sure, patents have disadvantages, but the advantages are greater."**

A study [4] from 2018 shows that the cost of patents is higher than the "rent" they can get out of patents. Rent in this case means the profit you can take out of patents:

> _"A patent grants an exclusive right to exploit an invention for a limited time, allowing a_ _patentee to obtain market power, and earn economic "rents," in markets for products and technology. Ideally, expected rents move innovation incentives toward the socially optimal level."_

> _"If rents from patents are below private costs generated by patents, however, then it is_ _questionable whether patent rents improve innovation incentives"_

And that is exactly what they find in the study. The cost of defending against patent fraud, hiring lawyers and suing competitors is higher than the rent they can get from the patents:

"We find that private costs exceed private rents during 1999-2000 and the trend in costs is sharply higher. Costs also exceed forecasts of rents for 2005-09. A surge in the number of NPE lawsuits contributes to the increase in the gap."

In the study, they also manage to show over time that the cost of patents has increased at a faster rate than the "rent" since the 1980s:

![figure](https://thephilosophyaddict.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/figure.png)

> _"Figure 1 shows that annual growth in costs (16.2%) sharply exceeds growth in rents (6.2%). As a result, estimated costs are higher than estimated rents during 1999-2000 and exceed foretasted rents during 2005-09"_

They also take examples from older studies that suggest that companies and individuals who have been sued by another due to patent infringement reduce their ability to innovate:

> "Recent research has shown that firms sued for patent litigation significantly _curtail innovative activity (Tucker 2014; Cohen, Gurun and Kominers 2014) and, due to the lower level of innovation, lose demand for their product lines (Tucker 2014)."_

4. **"Patents defend the small from the big."**

In the aforementioned study so they also address that small companies reduce their research investment six times more than large companies after each time they are sued:

> _"First, we find that percentage losses vary with firm size. Most notably, firms with below $100 million in revenue lose more than 1% per event, while rms with higher revenue lose no more than 0.15% per event. Small firms are more likely to have a small number of product lines, and a single patent lawsuit could destroy a small firm. For larger firms, patent disputes are more of a routine part of doing business."_

Large companies simply have an established infrastructure of lawyers and legal experts who can easily and relatively cheaply defend companies they are employed by and attack others, while small companies can go completely bankrupt if they are sued once and lose.

Patents are therefore a way of centralizing and consolidating industry and giving rise to oligarchies and monopolies. Patents simply remove technology from the many and put them in the hands of the few. Patents make the rich richer, and the poor poorer.

Patents create artificial shortages of goods, which raises the price. This means that the poor cannot use, experiment or buy new technology themselves and must either let the oligopoly decide to reduce prices or wait until the patents expire after 20 years.

Patents are unnecessary and must be disposed of. They provide few incentives for research, and if they do, the cost is higher than the profit. It centralizes industry and companies among very few hands and poor individuals are most negatively affected by them.
