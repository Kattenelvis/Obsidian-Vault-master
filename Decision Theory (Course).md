psychological hedonism: The only desires are to turn off unpleasant thoughts, chase dopamine. Maximise pleasure.

I think there are good reasons to disagree with both statements.


Thick moral terms: Being both factual and normative.

10\*0.5 + 0\*0.5 = 5
0\*0.5 + 10\*0.5 = 5
9\*0.5 + 9\*0.5 = 9

# Seminar 1 Bayesian vs Ecological




Paper 1: Higher stakes? Heuristics, mental shortcuts, minimal cognitive effort while making good decisions.
Reflects "ecological decision makers", reflecting the structure of one's biology and one's environment (cartesian!!! good!)

Don't weight all options nor all data.

"Less is more" having less information or relying on fewer cues can lead to better decisions. 

Works best in uncertain and complex environments.

Cognitive science has been treated unfairly. Second option or less interesting

Overfitting

Folk physics etc

Complex systems 3 by 3 matrix and above. Non-linearity, but with full data.

Act co-ordination

Heuristics are good except when they're not heh






Paper 2

How you structure problems

Well-structured problems
1. Testability (seems like NP stuff)
2. Problem space representation. Initial state, final state. Like the space off chess board configuration
3. Define steps from states to goal state
4. Organize knowledge in the problem space?
5. Solving a "real-world" problem. Then the problem space representation represent physical laws
6. Practicality. Tractable algorithm

Problems which are not well-structured are ill-structured.

Building a house example: It is unclear what the final state is. But can give a final state? 

AI can solve problems by "making the problem smaller". 

AI should solve well-structured problems? Only?
GOFAI probably

Willingness to pay as a way to evaluate outcomes


Organizations utilize this as a way to make decisions

Resolution rules: 

Dominant alternative. Take property $i$, for all $a$, take the one where $a_i > a_j$ for all j not equal to i. 

Leximin: Keep doing dominant alternative by removing the worst off one.

Threshold values![[Pasted image 20250203093652.png]]

Incomparable utility functions between agents

But we need to find a way to make them comparable


Set the sum of worst attributes to 0.

v(150) + ... = 0

Then finding comparable improvements.

May's theorem: Majority rule iff 
![[Pasted image 20250210094253.png]]

But majority rule may lead to non-transitivity

So an impossibility theorem with those properties and non-transitivity.

p(x>y) means the probability that we have x>y. Uncertain preferences.
