Simon Saunders (1993a) discusses the structural continuities between classical and quantum mechanics and also
shows how much structure Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy have in common. Harvey Brown (1993) explains
the correspondence between Special Relativity and classical mechanics. Jonathan Bain and John Norton (2001)
discuss the structural continuity in descriptions of the
electron, as does Angelo Cei (2004). Votsis (2011) considers examples of continuity and discontinuity in physics.

"… but it comes with some trade-offs. As a historical example of preparadigmatic research, here’s [Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions) talking about optics before Newton:

> Being able to take no common body of belief for granted, each writer on physical optics felt forced to build his field anew from its foundations. In doing so, his choice of supporting experiment and observation was relatively free, for there was no standard set of methods or of phenomena that every optical writer felt forced to employ and explain. Under these circumstances, the dialogue of the resulting books was often directed as much to the members of other schools as it was to nature."
