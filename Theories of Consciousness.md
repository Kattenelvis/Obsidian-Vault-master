Global Workspace Theory

"(1) neural states that carry information that is not accessible (_subliminal_ information); (2) states that carry information that is accessible but not accessed (not in the workspace; _preconscious_ information); and (3) states whose information is accessed by the workspace (_conscious_ information) and is globally accessible to other systems."
