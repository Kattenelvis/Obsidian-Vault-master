Now, the framework in question involves treating the concept of truth as typed (in that thetruthpredicate is applied onlytosentencesthatdonotthemselvesinvolve the truth predicate). But, as Gödel noted, an adequate formalization of the concept of truth involves treating it as type-free (in that the truth predicate can apply to sentences involv ing the truth predicate). And, as we have seen, he held out hope that once we discovered an adequate type-free theory of truth we would be in a position to prove the first disjunct. Interestingly, Penrose’s new argument involves treating truth as type-free.
