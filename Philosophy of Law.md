## Natural Law

Overlap thesis: There is overlapp between ethics and law

Natural law theory agrees with the overlapp thesis

Aquinas and Blackstone agrees

> This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original (1979, p. 41).

"In this passage, Blackstone articulates the two claims that constitute the theoretical core of classical naturalism: 

1) There can be no legally valid standards that conflict with the natural law. 

2) All valid laws derive what force and authority they have from the natural law. On this view, to paraphrase Augustine, an unjust law is no law at all."

Lon Fuller (1964) rejects the idea that there are necessary moral constraints on the content of law. On Fuller’s view, law is necessarily subject to a _procedural_ morality consisting of eight principles:

> P1: the rules must be expressed in general terms;  
> P2: the rules must be publicly promulgated;  
> P3: the rules must be prospective in effect;  
> P4: the rules must be expressed in understandable terms;  
> P5: the rules must be consistent with one another;  
> P6: the rules must not require conduct beyond the powers of the affected parties;  
> P7: the rules must not be changed so frequently that the subject cannot rely on them; and  
> P8: the rules must be administered in a manner consistent with their wording.


## Legal Positivism 

Opposed to all forms of naturalism is [legal positivism](https://iep.utm.edu/legalpos), which is roughly constituted by three theoretical commitments: 

(i) The _Social Fact Thesis_ (which is also known as the _Pedigree Thesis_) asserts that it is a necessary truth that legal validity is ultimately a function of certain kinds of social facts. 

(ii) The _Conventionality Thesis_ emphasizes law’s conventional nature, claiming that the social facts giving rise to legal validity are authoritative in virtue of some kind of social convention. 

(iii) The _Separability Thesis_, at the most general level, simply denies naturalism’s Overlap Thesis; according to the Separability Thesis, there is no conceptual overlap between the notions of law and morality.
