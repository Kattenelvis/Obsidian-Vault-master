How Gödelian Ontological Arguments Fail Matthew W. Parker
Gödel (1995) introduced a new class of formal arguments for the existence of God, appealing to a notion of “positive” property and applying modal logic. Gödel’s premises were later shown to imply modal collapse, i.e., if they are true, then everything true is necessary (Sobel 1987), and then to be inconsistent (Benzmuller and Paleo 2016). However, Anderson (1990) and Pruss (2009; 2012) give simpler versions that avoid these problems.
