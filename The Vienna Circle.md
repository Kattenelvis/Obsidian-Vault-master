> Can't one supplement a Carnapian formal approach in some ways to get around it? In fact, two sources for where the needed supplement may come from suggest themselves: the history and the sociology of science. These are natural suggestions as soon as one realizes that, while Carnap never explored the history or the sociology of science much himself, other members of the Vienna Circle did. (Otto Neurath is well known for his emphasis on the sociology of science; and works by Philip Frank, among others, engage seriously with the history of science.)
