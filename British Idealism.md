1.  His magnum opus of philosophy, _Appearance and Reality_, has two really good chapters. Then he gets into the mucking about in chapter three.
    
    Pretty much everything afterward is derivative from the first three chapters and just continuously restates the same thing as the third over, and over, and over again


    You'd have a better time reading Josiah Royce anyway. He was an influence on William James, who was an influence over him, and he actually incorporates notions of classical logic into his analysis and critique of said logic and propagation of the Absolute and a dialectical process
    
    
    Royce's masterwork, _The World and the Individual_, is genuinely just more interesting to read as well. Has more of a wide-reaching scope, dealing with the nature of philosophy and teaching and the search for meaning before getting into chapter one. Chapter one IIRC deals with the Law of Excluded Middle primarily. It's been a while though, I could be misremembering.
    
    
    But Bradley's _Essays On Truth and Reality_ is also just good. It's his account of coherentism and the nature of truth in Absolutist terms.

    But, yeah. Royce is the more consistent, albeit definitely the more extrinsically motivated author here. He was very, very Christian.
