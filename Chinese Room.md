Argument by Searle 
Shaffer (2009):

(I think there's a slight mistake, should be $\langle C_i, E_i\rangle$)

Shaffer takes on the Systems approach which accepts that the occupant doesn't understand, however some other set/subset/superset of the system does. Some claim the entire room understands. Searle replies to some of them, stating that if a person where to internalize all the rules then they'd still not understand. Such a person could live their lives and go around talking fluently with chinese people. However, this is only when prompted. That person may not understand what the words "cheeseburger" or "rock" in Chinese stand for. However, what if as a part of the rulebook, there were images and words related to those images. Then if a chinese person asks "what is that" and points to a rock, it might be able to express "rock" despite not seeing that rock before. 



Idea: A mix of cognitive phenomenology, the room response and the cyborg can meet Searle's own anticipated objection to such a combined response. Since thought essentially involves what-it-is-likeness, then anyone which has memorized the entire room will have a thought about the room and its rules. So it has atleast one necessary condition for being a thought.
