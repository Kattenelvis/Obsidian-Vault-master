Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox
http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf


The case for dismanteling planets: Earth has a mass of $10^{23}$ kg and if we dismantled earth we could turn each atom into a one or zero for a gigantic computer, then there would be $10^x$ (TODO:find out X) atoms of earth, thus $10^x$ bits of information. That means $10^x$ yes/no questions about how a simulated planet should look. This way, rather than planets standing around doing nothing, we can dismantle them to generate an insane amount of simulated worlds.

# Hedonium

[Posted onJanuary 5, 2017](https://qualiacomputing.com/2017/01/05/hedonium/) by [algekalipso](https://qualiacomputing.com/author/algekalipso/)

Desiring that the universe be turned into Hedonium is the straightforward implication of realizing that everything wants to become music.

The problem is… the world-simulations instantiated by our brains are really good at hiding from us the what-it-is-likeness of peak experiences. Like Buddhist enlightenment, language can only serve as a pointer to the real deal. So how do we use it to point to Hedonium? Here is a list of experiences, concepts and dynamics that (personally) give me at least a sort of intuition pump for what Hedonium might be like. Just remember that _it_ is way beyond any of this:

	What would you say to someone like Nietzsche who believes in the transformative (and even transcendent) effect of suffering? Certainly a lot of spiritual progress in an individual can arise as the result of testing and turbulent times.

    
    Thanks for the question. I think that 99.9% of suffering is unnecessary and adds no value. I define suffering as “more than 50% of your valence is negative” and allow for “positive states” that include some level of turbulence and pain. Suffering states are generally extraordinarily demotivating (if you feel inspired by them chances are you are not *truly* suffering, and rather are experiencing a bitter-sweet mixed state). The view that depression, for example, inspires artists and helps you spiritually is AFAIK a myth; artists are far more productive when in a positive mood. Likewise, spiritual progress is IMO proportional to the degree you have committed yourself to help prevent the suffering in all sentient beings. For this, I agree, suffering oneself can be motivating, because it acquaints you with the raw feels of it and helps you see that it is bad (and it’s badness is not a fiction or illusion).
    
    For a full rundown of arguments, I would point you to David Pearce’s Hedonistic Imperative section 4 where he discusses objections.


The last of suffering is possible the lest mother who sees her children die, the last poor starving person collapsing on the street, the last billionare living lavishly while everyone else is barely scraping by, the last of natural selection and starving animals, the last trampled flower, the climate disaster averted.

The sound turned into the best music, the combination of the best tastes, best visual sight, best harmony with body and limb position, balance sense, the best emotional states, we will achieve the highest valence of consciousness possible.

My plan for the future:

2045: Hyperintelligence is invented, it is tasked to transform the universe into hedonium
2046: Humanity abolished, merged with the hyperintelligence
2047: Earth is dismantled for resourcer, dyson swarm construction begins, planets are turned into factories
2048: Von Neumann probes go out to other star systems and starts reconstructing them. Massive planet sized science labs try to find the best mental states possible.
2055: The first probes reach our closest stars, they keep sending probes out futher and further out. Dyson sphere done. Matrioriska brain started construction. 
5000: Most of the milky way galaxy colonised. 4 billion galaxies to go. The Hyperintelligence is now a Type 3 civilization. 
1000000: Most of the 4 billion galaxies colonised, god like powers. Perfect univerwsal harmony, no suffering for a massive amount of qualia. A potentially large amount of the universe is no longer suffering, the qualia points are in positive valence. 
999999999999999: Entropy ends everything, including the hyperintelligence. The last stations utilising the rotational energy of supermassive black holes run slow simulations with the last, party, of the universe (given the big crunch or similar cycles don't happen).

The billion year long universal psychadelic experience will commence


Longevity Escape Velocity - LEV, where aging research reverses biological age by one year for every passing year.



When I was a child I thought we could keep earth around as a museum and move it away from the growing sun. These days I have grander ambitions. The earth contains many valuable resources, from silicon, nickel, cobolt, iron, copper, uranium, carbon, neon, helium e.t.c that could be more useful building massive paradise simulations and we can store all that data about atleast the surface of earth in computers that will last much longer. Earth is also an entropic system so heat dissipation could be prevented by restructuring earth. Also, wild animal suffering could be abolished. 



## Justifying Transhumanism

Not having to deal with the needs of being a human could greatly improve happiness, as the suffering of unfulfilled needs would be met. Some might disagree of course.

Transhumanism could aid in all three views of happiness and well-being, given that wireheading, using new products to satisfy desires (or removing desires such as hunger through computational mind upload for instance) or allowing for quick knowledge gathering. I currently don't know which one of these three truly represent well-being, or if there's a secret fourth one or some synthesis of the three. So I hedge my bets and improve on all of them, and transhumanism does just that.
