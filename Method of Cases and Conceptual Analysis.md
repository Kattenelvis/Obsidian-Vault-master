# Examples: Justice

### Case 1: The Innocent Person

**Scenario**: A government discovers that executing an innocent person will prevent widespread panic and save many lives. **Intuition**: It is unjust to punish or execute an innocent person, regardless of the potential benefits. Justice requires protecting the innocent.

### Case 2: Distribution of Resources

**Scenario**: In a society, resources are distributed equally among all citizens, but this results in everyone having just enough to survive without any luxury or comfort. **Intuition**: Equal distribution is fair, but some might feel that justice also involves recognizing merit and effort. Thus, a system that rewards hard work while ensuring basic needs could be more just.

### Case 3: Retributive Justice

**Scenario**: A person commits a heinous crime and is sentenced to a harsh punishment that matches the severity of their crime. **Intuition**: Retributive justice, where the punishment fits the crime, seems intuitively fair. However, the severity of the punishment should not violate human rights or dignity.

### Case 4: Restorative Justice

**Scenario**: Instead of imprisonment, a criminal is required to directly compensate their victims and participate in community service to repair the harm done. **Intuition**: This approach can be seen as just because it focuses on healing and restoring relationships, rather than simply punishing the offender.

### Case 5: Affirmative Action

**Scenario**: A university implements an affirmative action policy that gives preferential treatment to historically marginalized groups in its admissions process. **Intuition**: This policy can be viewed as just because it aims to rectify historical injustices and promote equality. However, some may feel it's unjust to give preference based on group membership rather than individual merit.

### Case 6: Wealth Inequality

**Scenario**: A small percentage of the population controls the majority of the wealth, while a significant portion lives in poverty. **Intuition**: Extreme wealth inequality is seen as unjust because it leads to disparities in opportunities, health, and quality of life. A more just society would ensure a fairer distribution of wealth.

### Case 7: Self-Defense

**Scenario**: A person kills an attacker in self-defense. **Intuition**: Killing in self-defense is often seen as just because it is a response to an immediate threat and aims to preserve one's own life.

### Case 8: Punishment for Minor Offenses

**Scenario**: A person is given a severe punishment for a minor crime, such as a long prison sentence for shoplifting. **Intuition**: Disproportionate punishment for minor offenses is unjust. Justice requires that the punishment be proportionate to the crime.

### Case 9: Corporate Responsibility

**Scenario**: A corporation pollutes a river, causing significant harm to local communities and ecosystems. **Intuition**: The corporation should be held accountable and responsible for compensating affected communities and restoring the environment, as justice demands rectifying harm caused.

### Case 10: Vigilante Justice

**Scenario**: A community takes the law into their own hands and punishes a known criminal because they believe the legal system is ineffective. **Intuition**: While the desire for justice is understandable, vigilante justice is generally seen as unjust because it bypasses the rule of law and due process.

### Case 11: Differential Sentencing

**Scenario**: Two individuals commit the same crime but receive different sentences due to differences in their socioeconomic status. **Intuition**: Differential sentencing based on socioeconomic status is unjust because justice requires equal treatment under the law.

### Case 12: Child Labor

**Scenario**: In a poor country, children are employed in hazardous conditions because their families depend on their income for survival. **Intuition**: Child labor is unjust, particularly in hazardous conditions. Justice demands protecting children and providing alternatives for families to survive without exploiting their children.

These cases illustrate various aspects of justice, and the intuitions provided reflect common moral sentiments about fairness, equality, and the protection of rights. Balancing these intuitions with theoretical principles helps in developing a more nuanced understanding of justice.

# Examples: Knowledge

### Case 1: The Gettier Problem

**Scenario**: A person, Smith, has a justified belief that Jones will get the job because he has strong evidence. However, Smith's belief is true by coincidence because Smith, not Jones, gets the job due to an unexpected decision by the employer. **Intuition**: Despite having a justified true belief, Smith does not have knowledge because his belief was true due to luck rather than the evidence he had. This challenges the idea that knowledge is simply justified true belief.

### Case 2: The Fake Barn

**Scenario**: Henry is driving through the countryside and sees what looks like a barn. He forms the belief that he is seeing a barn. However, unbeknownst to him, he is in an area filled with fake barn facades, and the one he sees happens to be a real barn. **Intuition**: Henry does not have knowledge because his belief was formed in an environment where it could easily have been false. The reliability of the belief-forming process is questioned.

### Case 3: Perceptual Knowledge

**Scenario**: Jane sees a red apple on the table and believes there is a red apple on the table based on her perception. **Intuition**: Jane has knowledge because her belief is directly based on reliable perceptual evidence. Perception is generally considered a reliable source of knowledge.

### Case 4: Testimony

**Scenario**: A child believes that the Earth is round because their teacher told them so. **Intuition**: The child has knowledge because testimony from a reliable and knowledgeable source (the teacher) is a valid way to acquire knowledge, even if the child doesn't understand all the evidence themselves.

### Case 5: Memory

**Scenario**: Sarah recalls that she locked the door when she left home in the morning. **Intuition**: Sarah has knowledge if her memory is reliable and she has no reason to doubt it. Memory is considered a legitimate source of knowledge.

### Case 6: Scientific Theory

**Scenario**: A scientist believes in the theory of evolution based on extensive empirical evidence and rigorous scientific methodology. **Intuition**: The scientist has knowledge because the belief is based on a robust, systematic process of inquiry and evidence gathering.

### Case 7: Introspection

**Scenario**: John believes he is feeling pain because he introspectively feels the sensation of pain. **Intuition**: John has knowledge of his own pain because introspection is a direct and immediate source of knowledge about one's own mental states.

### Case 8: A Priori Knowledge

**Scenario**: Mathematician Alice believes that 2+2=4 based on logical reasoning alone. **Intuition**: Alice has knowledge because mathematical truths are considered to be known a priori, independent of empirical evidence.

### Case 9: Contextual Knowledge

**Scenario**: In a classroom, students believe that water boils at 100Â°C because they learned it in science class. In a chemistry lab, the same students learn that water boils at different temperatures depending on altitude. **Intuition**: Knowledge can be context-dependent. The students have knowledge in both scenarios, but it's understood relative to the specific conditions or context.

### Case 10: Luck and Knowledge

**Scenario**: Tom correctly guesses the answer to a difficult trivia question without having any basis for his guess. **Intuition**: Tom does not have knowledge because his belief was true by luck rather than through a reliable method or evidence.

### Case 11: Technological Reliance

**Scenario**: Maria uses a GPS to navigate to a new location and believes she will arrive at the correct destination because the GPS says so. **Intuition**: Maria has knowledge because she relies on a generally reliable technology, assuming the GPS system is functioning correctly.

### Case 12: Deception

**Scenario**: Bob believes he is drinking coffee, but it is actually decaffeinated coffee that tastes exactly like regular coffee. **Intuition**: Bob does not have knowledge about what he is drinking because he has been deceived, even though his belief is based on his taste perception.

### Case 13: Expert Knowledge

**Scenario**: Emily, a non-expert, believes that a specific medication will treat her condition because her doctor, a trusted expert, prescribed it. **Intuition**: Emily has knowledge because she is deferring to the expertise of a qualified professional.

### Case 14: Collective Knowledge

**Scenario**: A group of scientists collectively holds the belief that climate change is driven by human activities based on shared research and consensus. **Intuition**: The group has knowledge because the belief is based on collective, corroborated evidence and expert agreement.

### Case 15: Inference from Evidence

**Scenario**: Detective Lopez infers that the suspect is guilty based on a series of clues and evidence gathered during the investigation. **Intuition**: Detective Lopez has knowledge if the inference is based on strong, reliable evidence and logical reasoning.

### Case 16: Knowledge by Acquaintance

**Scenario**: You believe that your friend is in the room because you see and talk to them directly. **Intuition**: You have knowledge because direct acquaintance with the person provides immediate and certain evidence of their presence.

These cases illustrate various aspects and sources of knowledge, and the intuitions provided reflect common philosophical insights about what constitutes knowledge. Balancing these intuitions with theoretical principles helps in developing a more nuanced understanding of knowledge.





We take some concept $C$, figuring out its colloquial usage (or atleast, my usage) of the concept and break it down into smaller parts. 

We can then say that a case $a$ upholds C if it upholds its smaller parts. $Ca \leftrightarrow (C_1a\wedge C_2a\dots \wedge C_na)$

The goal may be to find the fewest number of sub-concepts, given some precise definition for each sub-concept, which satisfy some list of cases $a_1,a_2\dots ,a_k$. This compresses the concept as much as possible. It is merely a descriptive fact about my own representation of a concept. One which approach a reflective equilibrium between concept and intuition. 

But if results in experimental philosophy is true, and intuitions fail to converge, and different agents or even the same agent over time may hold competing intuitions, this challenges the possibility of eventually reaching reflective equilibrium with regards to concepts and intuitions. 

Instead I propose replace conceptual analysis and method of cases.
