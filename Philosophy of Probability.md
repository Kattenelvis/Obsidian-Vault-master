"The **principle of indifference** (also called **principle of insufficient reason**) is a rule for assigning [epistemic probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_probability "Epistemic probability"). The principle of indifference states that in the absence of any relevant evidence, agents should distribute their credence (or 'degrees of belief') equally among all the possible outcomes under consideration.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference#cite_note-1)

In [Bayesian probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability "Bayesian probability"), this is the simplest [non-informative prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability#Uninformative_priors "Prior probability"). The principle of indifference is meaningless under the [frequency interpretation of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_probability "Frequency probability"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] in which probabilities are relative frequencies rather than degrees of belief in uncertain propositions, conditional upon state information."

"Applying the principle of indifference incorrectly can easily lead to nonsensical results, especially in the case of multivariate, continuous variables. A typical case of misuse is the following example:"

"In this example, mutually contradictory estimates of the length, surface area, and volume of the cube arise because we have assumed three mutually contradictory distributions for these parameters: a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous) "Uniform distribution (continuous)") for any one of the variables implies a non-uniform distribution for the other two. In general, the principle of indifference does not indicate which variable (e.g. in this case, length, surface area, or volume) is to have a uniform epistemic probability distribution."
