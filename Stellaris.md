My goal: Try to apply (EU bayesian) decision theory to Stellaris to try to win on the hardest difficulty! Could be an interesting exercise and not at all an excuse to make my addiction seem productive.

# Victory Conditions

Why is this not a wiki page? Regardless, so far it seem you can win by

1. Score victory by year set in start
2. Conquest/Purge
3. Cosmogenesis 
4. Star Megastructure thingy idk



Any action I take should maximize the expected value of my score. Apparently there's other ways to win such as building a specific megastructure but idk let's go with score for now.



Getting score:
**Economic Strength:** +1 per 1 Economic Power based on Relative Power **OR** +5000 if the Empire has no economy.

**Technology Level:** 60 +0.25 per 1 Technology Level over 60 based on Relative Power

**Number of Systems:** +10 per system

**Number of Colonies:** +50 per colony

**Number of Pops:** +2 per pop, regardless of type

**Subject Empires:** +50% of a subject empire's score is given to the overlord

**Federation:** +10% of each other federation member's score is shared by all federation members

**Crisis Ships Killed:** +10 per crisis ship destroyed

**Relics Collected:** Each Relic grants a large amount of score. The score of each Relic is shown on the [Relics](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Relics "Relics") page.




It's also competitive, becoming #1 could involve eliminating or subjugating other, higher scoring players. 
Subjugating is probably better since one would get 50% of their score. As such, diplomacy based builds might be good.

Ideas for games:

Megacorp, to understand trade and fix mid-game energy crisis?

Machine intelligence, rushing unity nanites ascention.





Space warfare works a bit like in FTL. Kinetics against shields, but laser against hull and armor. 

Late game usage of corvettes and destroyers in keeping their evasion up to 90% (the cap). This makes them almost untouchable, or atleast forces the opponent to increase their targeting. With the right kind of self-repair, it should be almost impossible for them to take damage.


> Evasion is primarily based on hull type and is a defining feature of the Corvette, Destroyer, Transport and similar small ships. It can be increased by thrusters, by the combat computer for some hull sizes, and by Auxiliary modules like the Enigmatic Encoder and by having surplus power in the ship design. The evasion rate is capped at 90%; because of this, tracking higher than 90% has no benefit.

# Early Game


Survey speed need to perfectly match the amount of time it takes to produce alloys and influence (or other resources depending on empire stats) needed to build a starbase.

No that depends...
