[Rational irrationality - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_irrationality)
"Rational irrationality describes a situation in which it is _instrumentally_ rational for an actor to be _epistemically_ irrational.

Caplan argues that rational irrationality is more likely in situations in which:

- people have _preferences over beliefs_, i.e., some kinds of beliefs are more appealing than others and
- the marginal cost to an individual of holding an erroneous (or irrational) belief is low.

In the framework of [neoclassical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics"), Caplan posits that there is a _demand for irrationality_. A person's [demand curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_curve "Demand curve") describes the amount of irrationality that the person is willing to tolerate at any given cost of irrationality. By the [law of demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_demand "Law of demand"), the lower the cost of irrationality, the higher the demand for it. When the cost of error is effectively zero, a person's demand for irrationality is high."

"Many of the claims of [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion") are not easily verifiable in the day-to-day world. There are many competing religious theories about the [origins of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth"), [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation"), and [paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise "Paradise"), but mistaken beliefs about these rarely impose real world costs upon the believers themselves. Thus, it may be instrumentally rational to be epistemically irrational about these matters. In other words, when forming or updating their religious beliefs, people may tend to relax their intellectual standards for the sake of driving popular support towards their beliefs.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_irrationality#cite_note-CaplanReligionDebate-5)"

"3.3 The Reformed Decision Theory Strategy

In contrast to the inseparable goods and social sanctions strategies that question the Foole’s characterization of the scenarios that give rise to a tension between morality and rationality, the _reformed decision theory strategy_ recommends that agents like the Foole revisit their understanding of rational choice. In particular it proposes an account of rational choice that is more subtle than the orthodox Bayesian account according to which rational choice is a fairly straightforward matter of maximizing expected utility. David Gauthier (1986) and Edward McClennen (1990) are the most prominent exemplars of this approach, with Gauthier proposing a principle of _constrained maximization_ and McClennen a principle of _resolute choice_. For ease of exposition we focus on Gauthier.

In _Morals by Agreement_ Gauthier distinguishes between _straightforward maximizers_ and _constrained maximizers_. A straightforward maximizer is an orthodox Bayesian who, at any given moment in time, chooses so as to maximize her expected utility given her beliefs regarding the relevant states of affairs and the choices her counterparts might make. A constrained maximizer, on the other hand, departs from orthodox Bayesian reasoning by doing her part to bring about a fair and optimal outcome if (i) she expects her counterparts to do their part in bringing about this outcome, and (ii) she benefits as a result of all following it. A constrained maximizer thus constrains her pursuit of her interests some of the time, but reverts to straightforward maximization if she expects her counterparts to act as straightforward maximizers, or if she does not stand to benefit from constraining her behavior relative to the scenario where no one constrains their behavior."

Essentially, “any rational choice analysis has to assume the prior context of power, expectations, values, and conventions.”

"The classic case of the Prisoner’s Dilemma can be applied to collective action on the international scale as well; sometimes, both actors will defect even though it’s not in their best interest to do so. Assuming that states will react entirely rationally ignores the fact that actions may not be entirely voluntary; states may be constrained by power dynamics, and prior constraints matter greatly. Similarly, a propensity for altruism, the ability of a state value long-term over short term objectives, and the willingness of the opponent to later retaliate against any possible defector are all also factors affecting a state’s decision to act a certain way.""


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem 

In Chapter 16, we show that any rational agent must behave as if it possesses a utility function whose expected value it tries to maximize. An agent that possesses an explicit utility function can make rational decisions with a general-purpose algorithm that does not depend on the specific utility function being maximized.
