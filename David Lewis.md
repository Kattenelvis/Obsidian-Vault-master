Ladyman naturalized metaphysics

"Lewis famously advocated a metaphysical methodology based on subjecting rival hypotheses to a cost–benefit analysis. Usually there are two kinds of cost associated with accepting a metaphysical thesis. The first is accepting some kind of entity into one’s ontology, for example, abstracta, possibilia, or a relation of primitive resemblance. The second is relinquishing some intuitions, for example, the intuition that causes antedate their effects, that dispositions reduce to categorical bases, or that facts about identity over time supervene on facts about instants of time. It is taken for granted that abandoning intuitions should be regarded as a cost rather than a benefit. By contrast, as naturalists we are not concerned with preserving intuitions at all, and argue for the wholescale abandonment of those associated with the image of the world as composed of little things, and indeed of the more basic intuition that there must be something of which the world is made."
