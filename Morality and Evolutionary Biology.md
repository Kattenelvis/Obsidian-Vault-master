"Evolutionary explanations for morality in the empirical sense are offered at different levels, and this makes for very different explanatory projects with different implications. Some typical _explananda_ in accounts of “the evolution of morality” are:

1. The general capacity for normative judgment and guidance, and the tendency to exercise this capacity in social life;
2. The capacity for certain sentiments and the ability to detect them in others;
3. The tendency to experience and to be motivated by certain sentiments in certain types of situation;
4. The tendency to make certain particular kinds of moral judgment or inference, or to have certain characteristic moral intuitions (i.e., a ‘moral sense’);
5. The tendency to exhibit certain particular types of behavior in certain types of situation (as a result of D);
6. The tendency of societies to exhibit certain particular systems of norms or types of practice (due to D and E)."


"The deeper point, however, is that _whichever_ position one takes on the role of natural selection in the emergence of generic capacities for moral judgment, this does not settle how best to account for other, more specific tendencies, such as C-F. In particular:

- Even if (1) our capacity and tendency to make moral judgments _is_ an adaptation that evolved through natural selection, it remains possible that (2) the _content_ of particular moral judgments is derived _autonomously_, i.e., free from causal shaping by particular elements in our evolutionary background—in roughly the way that the contents of our beliefs in physics or philosophy seem to be (see section 2.4 below).
- Alternatively, even if (1*) our capacity and tendency to make moral judgments is _not_ itself an adaptation, it remains possible that (2*) the _content_ of particular moral judgments _is_ deeply shaped by evolved emotional dispositions that have affected the content of moral judgments since human beings began making them. Such emotional adaptations may thus have influenced cultural norms throughout history and may continue to influence our moral judgments, and hence our behavior, today."

"And of course there are other possibilities: 1 might be combined with 2*, or 1* might be combined with 2, and both 2 and 2* could also be weakened to apply only to _some_ judgments, while others are explained in other ways, as suggested earlier. There are, then, many possible stories to be told about the origins of our moral judgments and behavior."


A hypothesis about the evolution of morality over three stages:

- Early hominids enter cooperative games (as per the game theoretic definition) in mixed adult groups of blind response to the preferences of other agents in their favour, as a way to ensure future cooperation as per repeated prisoner dilemmas. However due to selfish genes, the peacemaking activities necessary to upkeep such long-term cooperation would be excessive, such as for example picking way more bugs than necessary from eachothers backs.  
- The next step evolved so as to avoid this problem. By evolving the capacity for emotionally-laden normative guidance, via for example remorse or a sense of obligation, early groups of homo sapiens (and perhaps neanderthals) could enforce social cohesion, repeat prisoners dilemmas and fair ultimatum games. 
- In the final phase, [[Cultural Evolution]] occurred in which cultures and cultural units ("memes") are selected for based on cultural reproduction and survival. Would eventually lead to morality of democracy, human rights, an open society e.t.c.
