The underdetermination thesis states that for every scientific theory $T$ there exists a rival theory $T'$ such that they are empirically equivalent. This almost never happends in real life, so any argument for underdetermination must've been a non-constructive proof for the existence of $T'$. What if one could make a constructive proof? Creating a theory $T'$ from $T$. Analyticity and Synthecicity might come in handy, since once could just take $T$ and replace some terms with equivalent terms that are analytically equvalent. Like a sociological theory $T' = T[\textrm{unmarried man}/\textrm{bachelor}]$ where every instance of "bachelor" is replaced by "unmarried man". Such theories would be trivially identical and likely could not yield the same implications as with synthesicity. If such a distinction exists btw.
