Primitive terms:
"Which terms one counts as basic will depend on the solution one favours to Kripkeâ€™s sceptical problem. If one follows Maddy and McGinn, then the basic terms will be proper names and natural kind terms. If one follows Millikan, then the basic terms will be evolutionarily salient terms. If one follows Fodor, then the basic terms will be those whose tokenings stand in asymmetric nomic relations with their corresponding properties."
