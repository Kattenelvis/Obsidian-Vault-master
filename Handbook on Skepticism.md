From perception to object. 
Cause from idea to object, X to Y, constant conjunction, but we never encounter the object/Y in that case.

Realism claim
Directness claim

Skepticism SK

TOI <--> SK


"He was certain by consciousness, that he had the ideas of sun and moon, earth and sea; but how could he be assured that there really existed external objects like to these ideas?"

The Anselm version of the Ontological argument is interesting here, as then "God" would by definition be an external object so long as it is an idea


I may perceive K but not know it is a K.
Reverse hand argument

1. I know that there is a hand in front of me only if know that there is no Cartesian demon or Matrix manipulator making me believe erroneously that there is a hand in front of me.4 
2. I do not know that there is no such demon or manipulator. 
3. Therefore, I do not know that there is a hand in front of me.


"So direct realism is not sufficient for avoiding skepticism. Is it necessary? This, too, can be questioned. There are at least three types of thinkers who aspire to be antiskeptical without embracing direct realism: phenomenalists, advocates of in ference to the best explanation, and proponents of sui generis epistemic principles."

Phenomenalist strategy
"Phenomenalists renounce realism but keep directness."
$\neg R\wedge D$

"Phenomenalists renounce realism but keep directness. For a phenomenalist like Berkeley, a table or a cherry is a congeries of ideas, so in perceiving an idea, I am ipso facto aware of something that is (or may be) part of a physical thing. For latter-day phenomenalists like A.J. Ayer or C.I. Lewis, any statement about a table is logically equivalent to a complicated statement about what sense data are being sensed or would be sensed under certain conditions, so in sensing a sense datum, one can know that part of the logical content of the table statement is true"

IBE strategy 
$R\wedge \neg D$


Lastly, Chissholm
"For any subject S, if S believes, without ground for doubt, that he is perceiving something to be F, then it is beyond reasonable doubt for S that he perceives something to be F [and thus that there is something F].6"



More beautiful if the sunset is "real" and not just a part of one's experience. This might be the reason realism claims are so popular, and is not properly questioned. I personally believe there is no difference.



"
1. Wecanhavenoconceptionofanythingbutwhatresembles somesensation or idea in our minds.  
2. The sensations and ideas in our minds can resemble nothing but the sensations and ideas in other minds. 
3. Therefore, we can have no conception of an inanimate substance, such as matter is conceived to be, or of any of its qualities."


Nativism
Spatial extention innate (KaNT??!)

"According to Schlick, if a term is not definable by means of terms whose meaning can be conveyed ostensively—by displaying their referents within the content of our sensory experience—we cannot understand it. According to Dummett, if a sentence does not express a verifiable state of affairs—one lying wholly within the scope of what one can observe—its meaning can never be learned, and even if it could be learned, teacher and learner could never know that they were using their terms with the same meaning. Schlick and Dummett can be seen as offering ‘‘linguisticized’’ versions of Hume, transmuting what he says about the provenance of concepts into doctrines about the understanding of language."


3, Naturalism

"Even those philosophers who have disowned the authority of our notions of an external material world, confess, that they find themselves under a necessity of submitting to their power."
I don't


"P.F. Strawson has championed the naturalist attitude in his book Skepticism and Naturalism.18 Strawson says that according to the naturalist position, ‘‘whatever arguments may be produced on one side or the other of the question, we simply cannot help believing in the existence of body.’’19 Skeptical arguments are therefore to be neglected: ‘‘neglected because they are idle; powerless against the force of nature, of our naturally implanted disposition to belief."

Again, not true for me. On philpapers survey, Can seriously impact how one views Nozicks experience machine.

"Euthyphroquestion:arethingsevidentbecauseweareforced tobelievethem,orareweforcedtobelievethembecausetheyareevident?Ithinkthat Reid would endorse the latter alternative, which implies the falsity of the former."


4. Externalism


(KR) Apotential knowledge source K can yield knowledge for a subject S only if S knows K is reliable.33


![[Pasted image 20240729010337.png]]


Hard to accept self evident truths which are both contingent and general

"Reid believes that ‘‘the instinctive beliefs of healthy people...tend towards the truth,’’ and that such a tendency is sufficient (given a reliabilist view such as that previously sketched) for their being justified and amounting to knowledge when true.42 So the various classes of belief marked out in Reid’s list of first principles are not only psychologically immediate but epistemically justi f ied. When they are true, they qualify as knowledge, and this is so regardless of whether the believer knows anything about the reliability of his own cognitive mechanisms. As advertised, the KR requirement and its attendant skepticism are rejected."

Evlutionary debunking arguments?


Self-evidence that faculties are reliable

Epistemic externalism since an agent doesn't need to know some faculty is reliable for justified beliefs.



"My answers to these questions are yes, yes, and no. I do not envision any alternative to track-record arguments for establishing the reliability of our facul ties, and such arguments do indeed use the faculties on whose behalf they are employed. They are therefore admittedly circular in one sense of the term: they use premises generated by perception to argue that perception is reliable, premises generated by memory to establish that memory is reliable, and so on. But the form of circularity involved here is not the bad kind of circularity. The bad kind of circularity, the kind that would prevent an argument from being a means whereby you could come to know that its conclusion is true, is present when the following holds: you could come to know that the premises are true only if you already knew that the conclusion is true. But on externalist principles, that last statement is false. When we reject the KR requirement, we allow that one can come to know that various deliverances of our faculties are true without any antecedent knowledge that our faculties are reliable. In short, if knowledge of reliability is not necessary in the beginning, it is possible at the end. Such, in my opinion, is a further advantage of externalist interpretations of Reid."







!Dutch solution to problem of criterion:

Reliability of sense data with pure introspection, no need for inductive argument
Reliability of meaning grasping/analytic truths by same way
Combine the two: Understanding meaning/concepts of sense data
