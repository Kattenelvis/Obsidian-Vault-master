A type of belief updating (dynamic formal epistemology) where belief is updated by a axiom by axiom basis. 

Can work with coherentism. Multiple theories at once, derive contradictory statements, coherense is diminished. 

Can work with foundationalism. One BIG theory with the foundational beliefs as the axioms.
