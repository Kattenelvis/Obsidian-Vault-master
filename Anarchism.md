Two general definitions:

Ought to not exist unjust hierarchies:
$O(\neg \exists h (U(h)))$

Quick establishment of a classless, stateless and moneyless society: 
$O(\neg C(society)\wedge \neg S(society) \wedge \neg M(society))$

Where $\exists h$ predicates over hierarchies (a directed graph with certain properties) and $O$ the "ought" modal operator. 

While the first one is analytically true, the second one might be not be true. This is because stateless society might not be morally justifiable. To define the state one separates it from government/governance, that is to say, decision making can be made without the enforcement of a state but through other means that don't involve a monopoly on violence aimed at establishing game theoretic scenarios involving power imbalance or impartial information. A state is what establishes game theoretic scenarios in power, and can enforce certain payouts for individuals. 

But if moral realism is true, that is to say there exists stance-independent moral facts, and there exists a state such that the state always take obligatory actions and does not take forbidden actions, or atleast satisfy over a range of possible moral decisions very well, then it is moral for such a state to have authority to establish game theoretic power imbalance over non-moral (or not morally sufficient) agents, since this means more obligatory actions are taken and forbidden actions are not taken, or atleast, good enough moral decisions are.
