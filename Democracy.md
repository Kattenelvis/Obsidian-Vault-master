Arrows impossibility theorem
Minst 3 röstare minst 3 proposals 
ingen rank order (ingen restriktion över hur man kan ranka)
alla måste rangordnas
den kan inte vara diktatorisk en röstare avgör outcome 
independence of alternatives
unanimity (if a majority thinks something is better then it will be visible in the aggregate)

independence of irrelevant alternatives
failar $x_1$ och $x_2$ som fal du väljer $x_1$ men har du $x_1, x_2, x_3$ väljer du $x_2$. 
Cetersu Peresbu (allt annat lika) och helhetsprincipen motgår varandra
Aggregatet är icke-transitivt så failar den att dela. 

Icke dictatoriellt spel med minst 3 outcomes, är manipulerbar (inte strategy-proof). 

Condorcet gå en mot en kommer alla vinna till slut
Om det finns en sån vinnare så är att välja den vinnaren den unique resolute neutral annonym och icke-manipulerbar. 

Condorcet-hare är en röstning där man tar bort den sämsta. 

Condorcet Jury Sats
Anta en mängd independent domare sannorlihet över 50% att vara korrekt resultat. Ju fler domare du har destå bättre kommer resultatet av en röstning bli.

Centrala satsen för flytande demokrati
Om röstare kan icke-lokalt delegera sina röster givet att dom ger det till person med mer kunskap i ett nätverk leder oftare till mer resultat än direkt röstning.

Discrete median voting theorem
Om ett antal röstare och deras prefered proposals disteribueras över en dimension. Allar röstningar  som har condorcet kriterierna så kommer den rösta på median.
Generalisering till flera dimensioner/partiel ordning blir inte riktigt bra. 

Vote income wait-off theorem
weightoff: röstarna får ett antal poäng för en period som de kan spendera för att rösta. 
Kan ej existera om följande:
Unpredictablity: ingen röstare kan veta vilka röstningar som kommer att ske i framtiden.
Effektivitet: Inga system ska utföra exakt samma funktionalitet med mer tid och utrymme/minne/förslagslängd än som behövs. 
Flexibilitet: Få information och agera under en tidsperiod för att hantera kriser.
Unikhet av polls: Under en tidsperiod när man röstar så kan inte polls överlappa i beslut.

Anta predictability, så är det ej effektivt för man kan ta alla beslut poäng gång. Därför hanterar vi endast med unpredictability. 

Om unika och unpredictable --> inte flexibelt. 
Weightoff: 50% 50% kommer gå back and forth. 

There is no vote income system that is efficient and flexible that can avoid the risk of wait-off.



Criterions for democracy:

1. Clone independence will be satisfied if clones are not allowed to be presented in the discussion phase. Otherwise, proportional voting helps in this case. 

2. The majority criterion: if one candidate is ranked first by a majority (more than 50%) of voters, then that candidate must win. 
   
3. The Condorcet loser criterion: no Condorcet loser can be the winner. 
   
4. Reversal symmetry is a voting system criterion which requires that if candidate A is the unique winner, and each voter's individual preferences are inverted, then A must not be elected. In a deterministic framework, the participation criterion says that the addition of a ballot, where candidate A is strictly preferred to candidate B, to an existing tally of votes should not change the winner from candidate A to candidate B. 
   
5. A voting system is consistent if, whenever the electorate is divided (arbitrarily) into several parts and elections in those parts garner the same result, then an election of the entire electorate also garners that result. (inte viktigt)
   
6. A ranked voting system is monotonic if it is neither possible to prevent the election of a candidate by ranking them higher on some of the ballots, nor possible to elect an otherwise unelected candidate by ranking them lower on some of the ballots (while nothing else is altered on any ballot).
   
7. Mutual majority criterion: if there is a subset S of the candidates, such that more than half of the voters strictly prefer every member of S to every candidate outside of S, this majority voting sincerely, the winner must come from S. 
   
8. The Smith criterion is a voting systems criterion defined such that it's satisfied when a voting system always elects a candidate that is in the Smith set, which is the smallest non-empty subset of the candidates such that every candidate in the subset is majority-preferred over every candidate not in the subset. 
   
9. The majority loser criterion is a criterion to evaluate single-winner voting systems. The criterion states that if a majority of voters prefers every other candidate over a given candidate, then that candidate must not win. 
   
10. Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives (ISDA, also known as Smith-IIA or Weak independence of irrelevant alternatives) is a voting system criterion defined such that its satisfaction by a voting system occurs when the selection of the winner is independent of candidates who are not within the Smith set. 

11. The later-no-harm criterion is a voting system criterion formulated by Douglas Woodall. Woodall defined the criterion as "adding a later preference to a ballot should not harm any candidate already listed." 

12. The later-no-help criterion is a voting system criterion formulated by Douglas Woodall. The criterion is satisfied if, in any election, a voter giving an additional ranking or positive rating to a less-preferred candidate can not cause a more-preferred candidate to win. Voting systems that fail the later-no-help criterion are vulnerable to the tactical voting strategy called mischief voting, which can deny victory to a sincere Condorcet winner. 

13. Resolvability criterion can refer to any voting system criterion that ensures a low possibility of tie votes.

14. Condorcet winner

15. Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives

16. Polynomial Time/Resolvable


Better shorter versions:

1.  Clone independence criterion: adding similar proposals should not make the proposal less likely to win. The clone independence criterion becomes meaningless when overlapping proposals can not be put forth. Majority criterion: if one candidate is ranked first by a majority (more than 50%) of voters, then that candidate must win. The majority loser criterion and the Condorcet loser criterion are about the loser not being able to be the winner. Reversal symmetry criterion: if a proposal is the winner, then that proposal can not be the winner of all votes are inverted. Participation criterion: if a proposal is strictly preferred to another by an additional ballot, then this can not make the first lose to the second because of this (this is in a deterministic case). Consistency criterion: the electorate is divided arbitrarily into parts and these divided electorates aggregation leads to the same result.
    
    
    Monotonic: a proposal can not be prevented by ranking it higher or make a proposal win by ranking it lower (when nothing else is altered). Mutual majority criterion: if a subset of the proposals is preferred by most to every proposal outside of the subset, then the winner must come from that set. Smith criterion: a voting system always picks the winning proposal from the Smith set, the smallest non-empty subset of candidates such that every candidate in the subset is majority-preferred over every candidate not in the subset. Resolvability criterion: can refer to any voting system criterion that ensures a low possibility of tie votes. Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives criterion: a voting system defined such that its satisfaction by a voting system occurs when the selection of the winner is independent of candidates who are not in the Smith set. Later-no-harm criterion: adding a later preference to a ballot should not harm any candidate already listed. Later-no-help criterion: in any election, a voter giving an additional ranking or positive rating to a less-preferred proposal can not cause a more-preferred proposal to win.
