One definition: Qualia is non-representational intrinsic phenomenal experiences available via introspection.

Physicalist theory of Qualia: Qualia is identical with the physical, or is supervenient on the microphysical. Arguments against include Mary's room, What it's like to be a bat, and the zombie one.

"Philosophical zombies pose a serious threat to physicalist views of qualia. To begin with, if zombie replicas are metaphysically possible, then there is a simple argument that seems to show that phenomenal states are not identical with internal, objective, physical states. Suppose objective, physical state _P_ can occur without phenomenal state _S_ in some appropriate zombie replica (in the metaphysical sense of ‘can’ noted above). Intuitively _S_ cannot occur without _S_. Pain, for example, cannot be felt without pain. So, _P_ has a modal property _S_ lacks, namely the property of _possibly_ occurring without _S_. So, by Leibniz’ Law (the law that for anything _x_ and for anything _y_, if _x_ is identical with _y_ then _x_ and _y_ share _all_ the same properties), _S_ is not identical with _P_.

Secondly, if a person microphysically identical with me, located in an identical environment (both present and past), can lack _any_ phenomenal experiences, then facts pertaining to experience and feeling, facts about qualia, are not necessarily fixed or determined by the objective microphysical facts. And this the physicalist cannot allow, even if she concedes that phenomenally conscious states are not strictly identical with internal, objective, physical states. For the physicalist, whatever her stripe, must at least believe that the microphysical facts determine all the facts, that any world that was exactly like ours in _all_ microphysical respects (down to the smallest detail, to the position of every single boson, for example) would have to be like our world in all respects (having identical mountains, lakes, glaciers, trees, rocks, sentient creatures, cities, and so on)."


Functionalist theory of Qualia: Qualia is what plays a causal or teleofunctional role. So pain for instance has the functional role of avoiding damage using withdrawal behaviour. This allows for multiple-realizability.

< Idea >

Quantifying over qualia such as "All qualia has some feature" or "There exists some qualia with structure $S$" requires second order predicate logic to be quantified over, since qualia's are properties and thus its extension is sets.

Set of arguments that I think overwhelmingly demonstrate that qualia is not infallible/known by certianty (and also against Russellian Aquisition theory?)

1. Burden of proof on the other side according to methodological skepticism
2. Accepting that MoTG is a valid argument and rejecting 'the given' premise.
3. Frankish argument that evolutionary theory doesn't cohere with knowing qualia with certianty 
4. Any reliable process of qualia is not 100% reliable
5. Any process of qualia requires representing qualia and those cognitive processes are not 100% reliable

Fumerton says the 
BonJour vs Frankish: That qualia or aquantaince of qualia (whether the aquantance is a relation or intrinsic feature) is not representational according to BonJour but is to Frankish. If it is not representational then Frankish argument that it's no infallible goes away.

Interesting case of the continuity of qualia argument applied to smells.
