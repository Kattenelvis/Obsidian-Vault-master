Here is what I consider one of the biggest mistakes of all in modal logic: concentration on a system with just one modal operator. The only way to have any philosophically significant results in deontic logic or epistemic logic is to combine these operators with: tense operators (otherwise how can you formulate principles of change?); the logical operators (otherwise how can you compare the relative with the absolute?); the operators like _historical_ or _physical_ necessity (otherwise how can you relate the agent to his environment?); and so on and so on.—Dana Scott (1970: 161)

"Moreover, they also illustrate how different basic operators interact with one another, as well-known puzzles and paradoxes based on the interplay of modal operators (e.g., Fitch’s paradox of knowability, Voorbraak’s puzzle and the Brandenburger-Kesler Paradox)."
