So and so cannot change unless such and such changes.

Are proteins supervenient on DNA? Since if you change DNA you change the proteins. Well not immediately I guess, only future proteins. 




"P be the physical properties and B be the biological properties 

Def. X-indiscernible. Some objects xy are X-indiscernible iff for any F \in X, Fx iff Fy 

B weakly supervenes on P iff nec., P-indiscernibility implies B-indiscernibility 

Let T be our physical theory. T is deterministic iff an arbitrary set of initial conditions, jointly with its laws, entails a fully specified description of state of the universe at every time. This is all the physical facts, which for our purposes is the extension of the P properties at everytime. 

Since T specifies every P at every time, and since P-indiscernibility implies B-indiscernibility, then T also specifies B at every time. (Proof: Suppose there was some B-difference without a P-difference at any time for some x. Then x is B-discernible but not P-discernible, contradicting the contrapositive of our initial assumption of supervenience, which is logically equivalent to it) 

Since T is deterministic, and since T's fixing of the physical facts fixes the biological facts, it follows that any biological system that supervenes on a deterministic physical system is also deterministic, and also that if a biological system supervenes on a physical system then specifying the facts of the physical system specifies the facts of the biological system. So I believe there's no reason for our ideal fundemental physical theories to have biological primitives if there's even weak supervenience."
