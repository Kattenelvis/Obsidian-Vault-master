To sum up: felt-quality theories face three prima facie serious challenges. is is not to say that the
theory is hopeless. Felt-quality theorists have responded to the Heterogeneity, Oppositeness, and
Normativity challenges. ey have responded to the Heterogeneity challenge by arguing that pleasures
really do feel alike, despite our intuitions to the contrary (Crisp 2006, p. 109-110; Smuts 2011, p. 256-257;
Bramble 2013, p. 209-211). ey have addressed the Oppositeness challenge by developing views
according to which pleasure and unpleasure are clear opposites (Klocksiem 2010; Moen 2013). And they
have responded to the Normativity challenge, by arguing we have reasons to pursue pleasure even if we
are indiferent to it (Goldstein 1980; Rachels 2000, p. 201; and Bramble 2013, p. 213-214). So felt-quality
theorists have things to say about the HON challenges. Still, it’s clear that the HON challenges do require
responses from felt-quality theorists


> Disagreements about the contents of [A] are the most obvious disagreements among attitudinal
theorists. But attitudinal theorists might also disagree about the attitudes themselves. For example,
proponents of desire theories agree that [A] contains desire, but they might disagree about the nature of
desire. ere are, ater all, many possible theories. Some philosophers opt for an Aristotelian "guise of
the good" theory (Stampe 1987, p. 359-362; Oddie 2005, chap.3). Others opt for an attention-based theory8
(Scanlon 1998, p.38-42; Schroeder 2007, chap.8). Still others opt for various teleological and functionalist
theories (Papineau 1984, p.562-565; Millikan 2005, p.171-173). ese diferent theories of desire yield
diferent versions of the desire theory


At any given time, there are likely hundreds or even thousands of respects in which our
experiences are subtly pleasurable. We are getting pleasures from the visual perception
of colours, light, depth, the size of things, the shape of things, symmetries and
asymmetries in our environment, and so on and so forth.
[...]
Is it really plausible that unconsciously we have a crystal clear understanding of all these
various feelings we are having—that every one of them is known to us in all its detail or
complexity—and that we are holding court unconsciously on the lot of them,
simultaneously rendering hundreds of individual judgments concerning whether we
want these to be occurring? is just seems like a fantasy. (2013, 206)




> /Brentano's Theory of Pleasure and Pain Roderick M. Chisholm.pdf
> 
"Stumpf looked upon pleasure and pain as "sensory
feelings" ["sinnliche Gefiihle"] and was concerned with
the relation of such feelings to sensations. There are, he
said, basically three different ways of viewing such
feelings. We may say

> (1) that such feelings are them-
selves sensations, comparable to those of sight and
hearing. Or we may say 

> (2) that they are not themselves
sensations, but are "tones" of sensations, comparable to
such dimensions as brightness, saturation and intensity.
Or we may say 

> (3) that they are "neither sensations nor
properties of sensations" but constitute an entirely
different species of psychical element. 

> Stumpf defended
the first of these points of view and Brentano the third."
