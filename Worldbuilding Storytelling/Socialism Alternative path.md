1971: Cybersyn begins in Chile

1973: CIA interference is not enacted in Chile, cybersyn is allowed to continue. Cybersyn allows for a rapid growth of Chilean primary industry and is slowly incorporated into more aspects of the economy, allowing for efficient democratic and expert economic planning.

1976: The Swedish social democratic party implements "l√∂ntagarfonder", allowing labor unions to own an ever increasing proportion of companies until they have majority control. Finland implements a similar system in 1978, Ireland in 1979. Eurocommunist and some social democratic parties across western europe support the deal. 

1978: The creators of project Cybersyn successfully advocates the UK labor party to implement a partial version of a similar system in the UK, beginning with the coal mining industry and expanding outwards. Thatcher doesn't win in this timeline, and labour rights of Welsh mining workers are not threatened. 

1979: Yugoslavia implements cybersyn. Communist party of Japan and communist party of Australia adopt cybersyn as a goal for their respective countries. 

1981: Economic stagnation in the Soviet Union makes the people in the supreme soviet worried. Chile has now expanded project cybersyn to about half of the number of goods that the Soviet union has in its planned sector of the economy. It is established that cybersyn should be enacted, and greater workplace democracy is established in a limited glasnost. 

1983: Deng Xiaoping opens up with special economic zones and de-collectivizes agriculture, but doesn't open the economy up as much, as a Chinese version of cybersyn starts getting rolled out in some regions of China with great success. 

1985: Most of western European social democratic and left parties have successfully implemented partial versions of cybersyn in their countries, and labour unions have majority ownership in their companies. Tension in Europe diminishes as the economic systems of both sides start becoming more similar to eachother, and there's no weapons nor nuclear warheads race. 

1991: Apartheid ends in South Africa, and Nelson Mandela vows to establish union control and cybersyn for South Africa, and implements it throughout 1994-1998.

1993: The state of California, Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon and Virginia begins to establish "The American Cyberproject" (TAC) to distribute and plan resources using their own made system in silicon valley. This will slowly roll out across more and more states. 

1994: Treaty of Lisbon: The European Union is established. It's common market will begin incorporating a unified cybersyn system. The coal unions and steel unions of West Germany,  France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Italy begin incorporating their planning into a unified planning system. 

1996: The rise of the internet allows for vastly improved long distance transmission and greater throughput of planning and democratic decision making. The Soviet Union, with its vast length, benefit greatly. 

2001: With the increase in climate change related topics, many worker unions vote towards cybersyn projects of their nations and of cooperative projects to focus on green growth. President Al Gore establishes American GreenCyn across the united states.

2003: The world increasingly incorporates more and more industries into cybersyn in new ways. Primary industry, resource aquisition was always first, but major manufacturing facilities, powerplants, and the service and office sector is now also incorporated. Education, science, tech and other tertiary sectors increasingly incorporated aswell. 

2005: The Berlin wall is peacefully dismantled as both nations have approached eachother politically. Decreased tensions has lead to east Germany dismantling its police state, and both sides have established cybersyn style economic socialism. EU expands eastward, beginning with Yugoslavia. Eastern europe becomes more democratic and free.

2010: A good majority of the worlds nations have cybersyn projects, notable exceptions being South Korea, Brazil and Israel. About 26 nations, most of western Europe, have most primary industry and large parts of the service industry under union majority ownership. TAC have expanded to 34 US states. The eastern african community establishes a unified cybersyn system between Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi. Mozambique, ruled by socialists since fighting for independence from Portugal, is partially integrated aswell. ASEAN considers something similar, but Singapore veto's it. 

2013: Plans at the UN to begin incorporating global supply chains into a global cybersyn project. We call it CyberGlobe. A new UN commission is established. The EU expands to Turkey, Iceland, Norway, Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Soviet Union. Disbanding the Warszawa pact and NATO in the process. 

2017: CyberGlobe increasingly unifies the global economy. Climate change goals are met before expectations. CyberGreen is established to combat climate change. As most oil organizations are majority owned by unions or socialist states, lobbying against it is not incentivized. 

2018: China's belt and road initiative is started, incorporating global supply chains with global infrastructure projects. Many nations join in. Global high speed rail is built to fight climate change, walkable cities, renewable energy expands exponentially worldwide. Research into new nuclear reactors also get established. 

2020: The Covid Pandemic is easier to deal with, the economy can take the hit much better. 

2023: In a similar fashion to Germany, north korea and south korea unites. Both nations have become democratic and free, South korea has established cybersyn economic planning, a peacedeal signs the end of the conflict as two autonomous regions that will slowly incorporate eachother.

2025: A world going into the primary stage of socialism. Socialism spread through economic superiority rather than revolutionary bloodshed (for the most part). Life is good for most people. Living standards across the world are growing rapidly and equitably. GDP increase similar to our timeline, but with greater living standards and lower CO2 emissions. Science is advancing rapidly, about as fast as in our timeline, but with fewer negative effects as their voted away instead of being free to be pursued, such as social media algorithms not capturing as many. 

2030: Global AGI project: The worlds resources are pooled into developing safe AGI for all of humanity to achieve. Global cooperation is established in fighting for establishing AGI and ASI good for humanity. Instead of a race between nations, everyone cooperates. 

2040: Global cooperation succeeds, CyberAGI is invented, and establishes a new golden age where everyone has immortality, and can live in virtual worlds of unbelievable glory or alternatively explore space. Space is colonized for resources. Intelligence explosion and cyborgization established.
