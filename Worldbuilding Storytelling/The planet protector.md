The planet protectors

Relaunched to keep "it" intact. To keep "it" away. 


The saddened protector rolls from protector to protector



The zeno pillars exist all over the place, to lure one in

Is "it" at the core of the planet?


Symbolism of black=evil and white=good is reversed.


"No. Go"

And it went. It rolled. Genetically engineered to not be tempted to follow it.



Failure of one planet protector. 


"It" learns beings moves


Is finally lured in. Reality warps. Life flashes before his eyes as spacetime warps, revealing its past. It's birth in lab, how it grew up, graduated college in psychohistory, sent to the planet for a summer project to protect it from "it" whatever that was. Final consumption by the Zeno pillar. 

It then shows future events. They're consumed. The universe dies. 

"It" was a fictive thingy idk rolling up a boulder up a hill Sisyphus reference?

In the memories, he had no purpose. Was sent to feel like he had purpose. He was being protected against meaninglessness, yet found happiness. 

You could've just trued the pleasure pumps at andromeda-6

While you found yourself coping with enabling the planet protectors, you did not find fulfillment or true happiness. 


You reach into the light of the past. You are there now. You are at that location in spacetime. Everything feels fresh again, with a new sense of hope. "Hello other thing! Here I go".

A poppup screen shows up "You are about to violate causality, are you sure?"
Yes. No
