I really need to transcribe the thing I wrote down on paper here, it's great!





Mana as a resource distributed in space equally, resource shortages on earth. Have to enter space to collect it. Massive mana extraction power with magic workers extracting copious amounts of mana. The Moon, Mercury etc. The space-time spell type allows magicians to travel close to the speed of light, but sustaining it costs mana. Mana can be gathered during flights. Trade lines cannot reasonably be established without shifting the line alot. 


Idea: Make it like the Aether, so light propagates through it and people are unable to see things with too little mana.
