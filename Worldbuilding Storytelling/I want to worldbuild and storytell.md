I feel so pressured by other things to work on. I want the world to be in such a state that I can freely express worldbuilding and storytelling, specifically as a fully immersive VR experience for the future. I want the world to already be there. I am afraid it isn't, there's too much still left to work on before we can properly put ourselves in such a place. I could spend some time doing it, but why? I have other priorities, and I don't have time to become good or talented at it. Maybe I can appeal to a small, most likely atleast partially autistic audience in some niche subgenre who enjoys radical worldbuilding and melancholic stories, perhaps with horror elements. I am not sure I will ever be able to deliver anything truly good though. 

These documents will atleast be the beginning of it. I have long been thinking of making a truly magical realm. I lack words to describe the environments I visualise in my mind, I have to go back to game development or some kind of artistic medium to be able to express what I'm out for. I will likely use AI art for that, despite the inability for me to truly go in detail on everything. I can still give the overall world an interesting glow.
