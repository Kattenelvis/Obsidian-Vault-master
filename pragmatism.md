Idea: For any proposition $p$, there exists a goal $G$ such that $Kp$ is useful in attaining $G$. Proof: Let $G$ be the goal of knowing $p$. Follows trivially. Let $G=$ Maximise knowledge. Then it's also trivially useful. 

Potential ontology:
Pragmatism + Phyrronian Scepticism + Late Wittgenstein + Pragmatic Bayesian interpretation of QM
