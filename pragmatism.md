Idea: For any proposition $p$, there exists a goal $G$ such that $Kp$ is useful in attaining $G$. Proof: Let $G$ be the goal of knowing $p$. Follows trivially. Let $G=$ Maximise knowledge. Then it's also trivially useful. 

Potential ontology:
Pragmatism + Phyrronian Scepticism + Late Wittgenstein + Pragmatic Bayesian interpretation of QM
Me many months later: In retrospect that's a hell of a hodgepodge of theories I have no idea what I was thinking. Especially with Phyrronian scepticism in the mix. I guess I wanted to try a minimalist metaphysics.

Cool combination:
Fallibilism + Non-skeptical realism

$Rev(p)\wedge B(p)$


Ultimate revisability may be contradictory, see Quinean Revisability paper

"When we describe a judgment or belief as ‘‘infallible,’’ we identify it as be longing to an epistemic kind of which, of necessity, all members are true. If direct reports of sense data are infallible, then necessarily, all direct reports of sense data are true; if reports of one’s sensations are infallible, then all such reports are true; if intuitions of the rational structure of reality are infallible, then all such intuitions are correct. This assignment to a kind identifies a metaphysical feature of the judgment or belief that guarantees its truth. (This must be a nontrivial matter; we do not show that a judgment is infallible by assigning it to the class of ‘‘veridical judgments,’’ for example.)"

"If this is how we understand infallibility, then we can show that a judgment is fallible by demonstrating that there is no such kind to which it belongs. And this suffices to show that it is not infallible even if we feel totally certain of it and cannot conceive of what might lead us to revise our judg ment."





"The f irst of these concerns the structure of justification: there must be ‘‘foundational premisesandprinciplesofreasoningthatareself-certifying onthebasisofwhichthe meritsofotherbeliefsandprinciplesmaybederived.’’Allantifoundationalistsreject this, but pragmatists additionally reject a more fundamental claim: the view, at first sight a platitude, that rationally requires that all our current beliefs should be jus tified."

$\neg\forall p\exists q J(q, p)$

Which violates the premisse of the munchenhausen trilemma!



The whole intuition-judgment thing is about dual process theory in psychology

Intuitions as first beliefs

AGM updating then?
