    If you're referencing the Wason Selection Task, then I think you're making a very disingenuous point. The logics lacking contraposition won't flip the cards whose face is the negation of the consequent in the rule, and conversely neither will the logics lacking rule counterexample. In either cases, they could hold that although neither are sufficient to refute an implication, they information could still be helpful / necessary to do so. And the semantics of the indicative conditional is very contested in phil lang, semantics, linguistics, and there are various accounts of the indicative conditional (some deductive, some probabilistic). Among the deductive accounts, although some have proposed the classical material arrow like Grice, many more also propose the connexive arrow which is contraclassical, or the relevant arrow which is subclassical, and not all logics on this gradient would give the classical answer to the Wason Selection Task. To even presuppose that the classical answer is correct is already faulty in the first place, and judging natural language speakers's ability in logic by their performance on the Wason Selection Task is just uncritical classicism.

    Ahh hmm yeah I don't know. We're underdetermined by those hypothesises I guess

    You could check if whether after being revealed the answer they end up agreeing with it maybe?

    And there's plenty good evidence that people pretheoretically don't reason classically, hence why they get surprised by stuff like explosion / implosion, the fact that they usually accept the connexive theses if you present it to them until they realize those fail in classical logic, or the fact that they assume VSP holds until they realize that also fails in classical logic

    In fact for each example I gave here I know at least one person who's made that mistake and assumed classical logic had that property, then abandoned it after realizing CL in fact failed that property

    Across the vast majority of history, classical logic was not dominant. It was connexive logic from the time of Aristotle up to Abelard and even a bit after (e.g. all the way up to Alberic)

    Even after the post-connexive turn, classical logic never itself became dominant, but rather systems similar to what we today call systems of strict implication, as well as relevant logic in e.g. the Cologne school

1. Fwiw, I recently asked Aub. what's the weakest logic that gives the conventional answers to the Wason Selection Task. His answer was "Arruda & Da Costa's system P* + rule contraposition - LEM" ![👀](https://discord.com/assets/4b6781044811b929.svg)
