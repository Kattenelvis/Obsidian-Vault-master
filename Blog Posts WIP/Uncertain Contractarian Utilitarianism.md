Harsanyi was claimed by Gauthier to be a contractarian utilitarian of sorts. Rawlsian ish.

Gauthier is closer to what I'm for though, given the coherence argument foundation.

Cooperate if everyone have the same preferences

Psychological hedonism is true, i.e everyone prefers more hedonic states over less hedonic states

Therefore, cooperate with everyone.



Social contract


Another assumption might be the existence of mental states, which some eliminativists have said to be eliminable from our ontology. For any theory of practical rationality, actions is a requirement in such an ontology, lest it be impossible. 

Beliefs could in principle be betting predispositions, which in turn could in principle be determined empirically. Preferences could, given psychological hedonism, just be the amount of pleasure and suffering in some conscious state, maybe reducible/identical/emergent from/whatever else from physical (brain) states. Actions could likewise have to do with the sensation of taking actions, perhaps reducible/identical/whatever to physical (brain) states.

One potential "problem" with this view, is that we don't get a normatively guiding theory of practical rationality, we merely get a theory of psychology. This is compatible with eliminativism. 

I might be completely wrong here lmao

Money pump --> Transitive preferences
Dutch books --> Completeness

Transitive preferences and complete preferences imply linear preference relation/utlity function

Dutch books avoids sure losses (what kind of preference relation is needed? A utility  should be sufficient, but is it necessary?). Impossible or atleast unfeasible in reality to accomplish (AIXI uncomputability). So we adopt hueristics and bounded rationality, but try to optimize first-order rationality as much as possible with this second-order rationality. 

Different bargaining positions for different individuals. Rawls argued for a original position to go out for. I reject this, it cannot provide rational support based on the reasons given by coherence arguments. There is no "view from nowhere". 

Persons-affecting view yes, ideal observer theory no. Moral realism no, there are no stance-independent and necessary moral facts.

A social contract is formed between different unequal agents. Support a generally equal system as cooperatively optimal between agents. Rule-utilitarianism could be established, human rights, norms, virtues etc. Social choice theory, game theory, optimization theory, economics etc can be used for finding optimum positions.

Thus we establish a sovereign, based on an improper subset (could be optimal for all to have the entire population in some cases). Anarchism is generally sub-optimal. We care less for future generations, so no intergenerational welfare economics although tbh it can be used to model a long lived population. Population ethics consequences in general? It's not good for anyone before they're born to be born. What about anti-natalist views where it's bad for someone to be born? What about transhumanism? What about fair cake division? So many questions!

Gauthier set of essays.

Gauther grounds moral claims in rationality. Rejects moral intuitions and reflective equilibrium. 

Not all humans, animals nor future generations are part of the contract according to Gauther

Gauther's view has no veil of ignorance nor original position in general. We're barganing from our current position.

Arguments for extending the social contract to all agents.


We have agents $A_1,...A_N$ for a size $N$ population. We take it that only some subset $A_1,...A_i$ are part of the social contract, for $i<N$. 

Inductive argument: In the past, women and black people might've been excluded, but are now included (via suffrage and civil rights movements). Some at this moment of history argue for all animals to be included (vegan movement). We can draw the inductive inference that eventually, all consciousness will be included eventually.

Argument from rationality: Given the uncertainty of what happens in the future, to hedge one's bets it's good to support a social contract which includes all agents. In the future, one may become a simplistic mind. Why not, while one has power, push for a possible world where all lives are counted as part of the social contract?
