We will analyse algedonic phenomenology, form ancient Greek algo (pain) and hedonic (pleasure). We will begin with a naive analysis of pleasure and pain as something which is merely a state that can be less or greater, and that pleasure implies no suffering and suffering implies no pleasure. There will be an axis.

The simple idea could be as follows: Each conscious experience hold a single value $S$ which we can say represent pleasure states of consciousness whenever $S>0$ and suffering states of consciousness whenever $S<0$. This makes evaluating a utility function really is, for you can say that the utility of the conscious experience is identical to S. It would then be possible to do utility comparisons between individuals, assuming that there's some way of objectively measuring S 

It might be difficult to actually measure $S$, even in its simple form. The problem of other minds states that it is impossible to have immediate or otherwise non-inferential knowledge of the sensation states of things outside one's own conscious experience.

# Algedonic Phenomenology

There are different ways of distinguishing what it is is like to feel pain and pleasure. The question is whether or not other experiences in some way ground it, or whether pleasure and pain exist at all. In the book varieties of consciousness, there are 3 main positions on algedonic phenomenology

- Eliminativism, which is the position that pleasure and pain sensations don't exist, can be dispensed away from our ontology. 
  
- Reductivism, the view that pleasure and pain sensations reduce to other sensations, for instance sight, smell, thoughts and so on
  
- Atomism, the view that pain and pleasure sensations are fundamental, not reducible to other sensation states

We will simply say that eliminativism is false by introspection. I can easily cause pain sensations by pinching myself and introspecting on the pain. I can almost just as easily induce pleasure sensations. Anyone claiming to eliminate these states have the burden of proof against them. We will just ignore it for now.

There is more of a case for reductionism, since perhaps pain and pleasure are just experiences like any other, where it is just our thoughts or self-awareness that grounds pain. This might be corroborated by some who meditate and is able to handle large degrees of pain by learning to think away the pain. In animal ethics, some have argued that animals don't feel pain for the reason that only humans have the ability to introspect and be self-aware of pain. 

There's also a great case for Atomism. It might be considered absurd that one can just think away the suffering, and that some individuals merely get used to the suffering, or being exposed to some kind of suffering causes it to be less bad with training. It might also be absurd to consider that animals don't feel pain simply because they lack the awareness or thoughts about pain, they still feel it just the same. 

So for the rest of the article we will consider eliminativism as false, but will consider differences between atomism and reductivism about algedonic phenomenology. 
# Pleasure and Pain is located

Ryle 1954 argues that pain is located while pleasure isn't. His main argument is perhaps via introspection. We will argue that pleasure is also located just the same. A pretty obvious example is sexual pleasure, but other kinds of pleasure like feeling a nice textile in one's hand is for me atleast located.  When I eat delicious piece of chocolate I notice that the pleasure is located in the mouth, but for hype or eudamonic happiness sits more in the stomach. 

The mathematical structure we gave it before was a mere number $S$, where $S>0$ was pleasurable states while $S<0$ was suffering states (and $S=0$ being neutral states). Now we will have to give each location it's own sensation level, giving us the set $\{x,y,z,S\}$. However this might not be enough. Some report being able to feel pain and pleasure at the same time (for instance masochism) aswell as the report that suffering is not the same as pain since those with painkiller sometimes report feeling pain while it doens't feel bad. So we might wanna include positive sensation $P$ and negative sensations $N$, giving us the set $\{x,y,z,N,P\}$. 

There's also the potential of there being multiple different kinds of pleasure and sufferings, not just one, which might especially be the case under a reductionist account. For instance, BostrÃ¶m claims there's 3 kinds of pleasure while Bentham claims that there's a whopping 14 kinds of pleasure. So in that case $N$ and $P$ would not be numbers but rather sets of sets, describing the type of sensation and the strength of the respective sensation.

One way one can introspect on the locationality on pain is to for instance pinch the back of one's left hand and move it around. Alternatively, pinch a few points of one's skin to form say a +. This sensation will involve multiple pain points, proportional to how tightly it was pinched. 

Another argument one can bring forth is from neurophilosophy. According to the current theories of neurophysiology, pain receptors exists throughout the body, pain via C-fibres. However some theories posits that pleasure sensations is primarily caused in the brain exclusively. For instance, Szasz argues that there's no pleasure location, and that there's an asymmetry between the physiology of pain which would be located to the physiology of pleasure which is non-located. 

Opponent-process theory claims that suffering and pleasure cannot be active at the same time at the same location. In fact, many physiologists can take suffering to be the absence of pleasure. It's worth noting that what we're considering is primarily about the phenomenal experience, the what-it-is-likeness of pleasure and suffering sensations, not what our best theories say, though they can be informative, and in some physicalist accounts of the mind might give a better justification than introspection.
# The problem for value theory

Let's discuss the ethical consequences of pleasure and pain having locations within one conscious experience. It seems quite clear that sensations being located like this makes utility calculations even for a single individual more complicated. But Let's begin with just considering different theories of well-being. There are three main views 

- Hedonic-Pleasure-Sensation
- Desire-Satisfaction
- Objective List

The hedonic-pleasure view simply states that well-being consist of having experiences that are more pleasurable, and that nothing outside of one's experience matter for well-being. Desire-Satisfaction instead posits that well-being consist of satisfying desires, even when these desires are outside of immediate experience (think for instance, someone having the strong desire to write a book even though writing the book makes them miserable, or someone who desires to live in an external world rather than the experience machine or taking happiness pills). Lastly objective list tells us that well-being consists of an objective list of things such as happiness (eudamonic, "True Happiness"), knowledge, friendship etc. and that this list is completely independent of our own desires and final goals. 

To simplify things, for the rest of this article, I will merely consider the hedonic-pleasure account of well-being. Without considering the locationality of pain and pleasure, one could simply assume that the hedonic pleasure view allowed for easy evaluation on how well one would do. 

So let's discuss preference relations. In this context we will define a preference relation $\succ$ as a prefrence relation between states of consciousness. So for instance, if I say $a \succ b$ I will claim that conscious experience $a$ is preferable to conscious experience $b$. 

For $\succ$ to be classified as a utility function this relation needs atleast two properties: Transitivity and Completeness

Transitivity: $((a\succ b) \wedge (b\succ c)) \to (a\succ c)$

Completeness: $a\succ b \vee b\succ a$

We can then see that non-located algedonic experience upholds these properties. Transitivity makes sense. If some situation $a$ has a level of pleasure greater than $b$, and $b$ has greater pleasure than $c$, then it follows that sensation $a$ has greater pleasure than $c$. Likewise, either a sensation has less or more pleasure than any other. This means that the preference relation $\succ$ is a total ordering, meaning that it can map conscious states to say, the real numbers, allowing for the definition of a utility function. 

However here is where locationality becomes a major obstacle. 
Locationality implies the falsity of completeness of the pleasure-sensation preference relation. Let's take an example.

Assume that I'm holding my two hands up. Assume also that at some time instant later, I'm pinches in my left hand at the same time as some really pleasurable rubbing sensation on my right hand occur. Let's say the pleasure is twice as good as the pain of pinching is bad. This means that the pleasure in one location increased while pain in another increased. Describing the situation mathematically we could say that there are two locations $x_1$ and $x_2$, each of which with their own pleasure and pain sensation as such:

Before $=\{\{x_1, 0,0\},\{x_2, 0,0\}\}$
After $=\{\{x_1, 1,0\},\{x_2, 0,2\}\}$

It is unclear if this situation is preferred to the one before. How much worse does the pain have to be for the suffering to be better? At this point, we're more or less going from a perfectly neutral state to one where there is some pain and some pleasure. Which situation is better then? This more or less leads to the same problem as aggregating preferences in multi-agent situations, aswell as population ethics. For instance, do we prefer going from a neutral state to one where one person is slightly worse of while another is much better of? And in fact, some results in population ethics could have similar consequences for this view.

The repugnant conclusion, reworked within a single conscious experience. Assume you have an experience that is merely pleasure, i.e no sight sound etc. Assume this experience has some pleasure sensation S in locations 0,1,...n. This is less preferable to some pleasure sensations S+k in locations 0,1,...n and also some new experiences that are pleasure level $\epsilon$ that are barely positive at locations $n+1,n+2,...m$. This is then in turn preferable to lifting up those pleasure sensations so an average pleasure level $(S+k+\epsilon)/2$. If we keep reiterating this we end up with a sensation with many locations with barely positive pleasure sensations.

So the issue of aggregating utilities in a multi-agent scenario has an equivalent problem in just within a single conscious experience. But it's not just an analogy, how do we aggregate multiple agents preferences if they each have located pleasure and pain points?
