conceptual analysis, obsessive focus on language, questionable ways of employing intuitions

# Philosophy

In its highest generality, philosophy, science and mathematics is about arguments from premises to conclusions. This includes observation sentences. Philosophy, science, mathematics and other similar studies will be named "propositional derivative systems" to indicate their foundation in formal logic. 

To formalize this notion we fix a formal system $S$ for some language $L$ for which to formalise some argument in. The structure of $L$ can remain vague for now. It can be a propositional logic, a first order logic, second order, modal logic etc. $S$ can also remain vague, wether (under a propositional language) classical, intuitionistic, paraconsistent etc or however it deals with quantifiers, identity etc. 

In general, it will include formulas built up inductively from atomic formulas and grammatical rules, aswell as a set of inference rules. Some theory $T$ in $L$ holds the non-logical synthetic propositions of which an argument is formalized as. $T$ would then contain for instance, the axioms of $ZFC$ which are the premises in modern mathematics for its conclusions, $T$ may contain the postulates of quantum mechanics and observation sentences describing the experiments, and $T$ may be the list of axioms in integrated information theory and observation sentences thereby, $T$ can be Spinoza's axioms or $T$ can just be a small simple argument, for instance the cosmological argument or the no miracles argument. 

As such we get a definition of philosophy as the set of all such theories
Philosophy$=_{df} \{T_1,\dots T_n\}$

Or for some arbitrary indexing set
Philosophy$=_{df} \{T_i\}_{i\in I}$

Carnap distinguishes the analytic and synthetic in a way which is not critiqued by Quine's dogmas. Whenever we have a fixed system in some language, we can take it that the tautologies are the analytic statements and anything derived from an axiom in some theory $T$ is synthetic. 

We may very well distinguish philosophy from other propositional derivational systems such as science and mathematics in that it generally lacks observation statements while also containing synthetic propositions.

Notably, by these definitions, mathematics is synthetic. Note that this might assume Hilbert's thesis, the idea that mathematics is reducible to ZFC, which is usually taken for granted but may not be the case. However, the view may assume a logicist view on mathematics, such as Hilbert's thesis. 

Note, this is not a restriction on scientific methodology. Fully formalized science is compatible with even Feyarabendian approaches to method restrictions (i.e the empty restriction). 

It might seem to assume the syntactic structure of scientific theories, though with the right ZFC axioms in conjunction with the scientific theory we could easily accommodate the semantic view aswell. And natural language is not special either, the pragmatic view can likely also be accommodated. 

We also get the logical closure of $T$ as $C(T)$ which include all derivations of $T$. 


We thus get a natural history of philosophy as the adding of $T$'s
Historicism: More and more are added over time, adding to our collection of philosophies. A philosophy $T$ can be understood as adding to or negating a previous one.

Example:
Descartes:

$T=\{ \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg K(\exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$ (By modus Ponens)

Moorean Shift:

$T'=\{ K(\exists x Hand(x)), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$ (By modus tollens)



We may still be pessimists about progress, as it may turn out through the process of formalized Hermeneutics to be identical. 

Formalized Hermeneutics:
Adding propositions $T' = T\cup \{p\}$ 
Understands the whole better. 
Over time a finished formalism is done


Conceptual analysis is done withing T's which would include intuition statements (which would probably be similar to observation statements in science)


Meta-languages and meta-philosophy. Avoiding circularity.


Is there an explanation for why natural language is used when I'm arguing all of philosophy (but not necessarily meta-philosophy) is formal?

NP-hardness makes searching the space of possibly philosophies extremely time consuming, and has to be efficient by algorithms searching through that space in P-time, which humans seem to be decent at?

Like there's obviously a combinatorial explosion of possible philosophies

We can define positivism as the view that all propositional derivation systems are mathematical or scientific, with no extra categories. 



# Brief overview

**Conceptual analysis**: **Conceptual analysis** breaks down **concepts** into (perhaps multiple) other **concepts**. Examples include knowledge as justified true belief, free will as the ability to do otherwise, and supervenience as no x change without y change. 

**Method of cases**: **Concepts** are applied to **thought experiments**, or **cases**, of which **intuitions** are elicited and informs a revision of **concepts**. This works because we are competent speakers of the language the concept is in. 

**Reflective Equilibrium**: Iterated applications of method of cases eventually yield reflective equilibrium where the general concept definitions apply to all cases. 

## Conceptual Analysis

So as part of a formal theory we may for instance include:

$Kp \leftrightarrow (Jp\wedge Bp\wedge p)$
$Sup(x,y)\leftrightarrow (\Delta y \to \Delta x)$
etc.

## Method of Cases
Williamsons formalization of conceptual analysis applying method of cases.

$\square (Kp \leftrightarrow JBTp)$
$\diamondsuit (\neg Kp\wedge JBTp)$

The problematic intuition of the case in the possible world where the JBT is not K.  

His argument is no different from relying on intuitions.

I reject all $T$'s of which contain intuition propositions

The long term goal according to some is to achieve a  Equilibrium, whereby one has applied conceptual analysis many times, thought through many thought experiments until all universal laws match all intuition on all cases. [[Method of Cases and Reflective Equilibrium]]


Could an ASI predict ones intuition regarding any thought experiment, and thus could in principle perfect the method of cases?


## Reflective Equilibrium

Instead of just going by intuitions, we can sometimes reject intuitions, if they're for instance, not strong enough. 



## What are intuitions really?

Formal phenomenology. E = {V, A, T,...} for visual space V auditory space A and thought space T. T is most likely reducible to V. In the book varieties of consciousness, there are two views primitivism and reductionism (and also eliminativism but let's assume that's false for thoughts). I take the reductionist route.

Why rely on the phenomenal experience of "intuition" rather than the phenomenal experiences of "regions of blue"? 

So I reject intuitions, the Ah-hah feeling, and cast skeptical reasoning towards a priori foundationalism, focuing on a empiricist foundherentism. 


## Experimental philosophy

The idea is to test intuitions on lay people. Are horribly dependent on irrational factors such as someone's sex, ethnicity or age. 

Expertise defence is a natural defence, there is some special skill and/or talent philosophers have which has allowed them more fine-tuned intuitions which are actually true, just like fine-calibrating a scientific instrument to get the best scientific data. 

Turns out most lay-people intuitions still apply to experts [Source]. Expert philosophers are bad at modal reasoning, if anything, mathematicians are the modal experts [Source]. Extrovert lay people are just as more likely to believe in free will than introverts as is the case for professional philosophers. 


## Conceptual Engineering as solution


Explicative Definitions however we want, as are found in our theories $T$.

Carnap
Chalmers



# Naturalizations

Consciousness Research and AI research is the best bet we have. 

A real case against the rationality of working on most issues in philosophy: AI may be able to do it for us in the future

Science is like philosophy anyways, but with observation sentences as premises. 

IIT vs GWT as the two competing models of consciousness.

But let's not take it too far.

## Mental States and Folk Psychology

Naturalizations are sometimes eliminative about folk psychological states

Circularity without it?
Yet kinda bad and can be eliminated? Not sure tbh... Ask Youv

## The case for Narrow content

Phenomenal experience, see later, is fundamental. We don't hold representations that are wide in the environment. All contents in this article are narrow, as I've experienced them before. 

Since we've already discussed that intuitions and method of cases doesn't work, we can exclude arguments such as twin earth or g√∂del-schmitt cases immediately. We can still use them as intuition pumps, and explain narrow content.

In the twin earth thought experiment, twin earth has something like water, but is a posteriori identical to XYZ instead of water. We presume that H2O $\neq$ XYZ. The narrow, phenomenal content of water is the color of water, the way it sounds, feels and so on. The idea is that Twin Earth Water is by narrow, phenomenal content identical to Earth Water, but it's "intuitively false" that they would have identical content. I reject the intuition. 

Content construed narrowly allows for much better theorizing about mental states, is the only one important for folk psychology, is more coherent with Chomskyian I-language and E-language etc.


# Language


With the rise of Ideal language philosophy and Ordinary Language philosophy, no more substantive claims. 

Substantive/Naturalized philosophy can make comeback. Philosophy is more than no substantial claims. Maybe idk... 

Ideal language vs Ordinary article here, all of philosophy would then be analytic.

As such I think of a combination of ideal and substantive philosophy, and a rejection of ordinary language. 

Chomsky I-language and E-language. Rejecting the private language argument. 

Rejecting Kripkenstein. 



# Philosophical progress

Not quite true. But lack of it in some fields is cause for concern? Ehhh I guess lack of progress is only a concern whenever there is no finished consensus view that finishes in the establishment of something.

Add that article here

LLM's for progress?


With our formalisation we can now posit some progress. It's about the addition of systems $T$.  


# Common sense Philosophy

Radically relative
Experimental philosophy

Phenomenal Conservatism: With the unreliance of intuitions, there's no reason so support our initial beliefs until defeaters show up or anything like that

We could be radically wrong
Reid, who supported Common Sense philosophy does also take it that we *could* be radically wrong.


Moore and why the hand shifting argument doesn't work

# Ontological commitment
Quine on what there is

Quinean commitments on reality as it is, leads to arguments about the existence of mountains. Mereological argument:

$T=\{$Mountains are composites, No composites exist $\}$

So a consequence of this theory in a system which allows modus ponens yields "There are no mountains". 

"To be is to be a value of a quantifier"

I will hence forth reject that any $T$ has priviliged access to reality and is the true nature of it. I adopt a Carnapian view that existence just follows trivially from a theory. Let's say we formalize geology axiomatically as $G$ in some formal system. It's likely a consequence of $G$ that mountains exist. Geologists may not use $G$ though, as it may turn out a better theory for their goals is $G'$ which doesn't have that implication

# Thought Experiments

Proof by contradictions are not inuitionistically valid. Fine Ig??

Nortons argumentative view, some claim he is vague, so I will formalize this notion: 

a thought experiment is a theory $T$.

Usually meant to show some subtheory $T_s\subset T$ is contradictory, either by elliciting intuitions (by being an intuition pump) or as is often done in science, demonstrate ways a theory is logically contradictory in some situations.

We may sometimes ellicit intuitions


# Skeptical problems

Trilemma

Foundherentism.
I take it that sense-data is not an intuition. An red region R in visual space V is not an intuition, and forms a sortoff basic belief (with some complications I will get too). With empiricist foundationalism or empiricist foundherentism, there is no knowledge which is based on intuitions, but only in lists of sense-data

The issue is the myth of the given, which is remedied with a foundherentist system, developed by Haack and mathematically formalized by Thagard. There is a coherence relation between theoretical propositions, formalised in logical systems (all of which is definitional and explicative, no intuitions are ever used for any of the inference rules)

There are two kinds of justification, S-justification and C-justification, depending on if sense data is justifying a theory or if theories are justifying sense-data. But foundherentism takes a special priviliged role to sense data (though tbh I think she doesn't use the term 'sense data' so this might be a misscharacterization) because sense data is what upholds something which would otherwise be fully coherentist, and thus the typical problems of coherentism which includes that a coherent set of propositions could just be fictional

coherence function on a set of propositions and coherence relations, aswell as 5 optimization algorithms that try to maximise which propositions to put in a set to maximise coherence. Including a formalism of Haacks work


The problem of Beginning: Phenomenal Experience. Relevant to sceptical scenarios. I think sceptical scenarios are relevant and have not really been defeated. I think a philosophy which begins by positing external world objects will not be adequate to survive external world scepticism. As such I support philosophies which are robust to external world scepticism.



Problem of the criterion: How do we justify the criterions of justification? I don't know...


# No meta-philosophy

Only really philosophy of philosophy. It's just a set of object level debates of which is typically conceived to have a lot of importance for many other branches, which is already the case within many branches. As a consequence one cannot be "anti-philosophy" without making atleast one philosophical proposition or argument. 

If philosophy is "valuable" is just an object level proposition that follows trivially from a theory of value or decision theory $T$. 

We thus get philosophical knowledge. Knowing a system $T$. Follows trivially from epistemological theories $T$ what counts as knowledge or not, just like philosophical value.

Likewise, debates about methodologies in for instance, analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatic philosophy all turn out to be some set of mostly object-level debates. 

Analytic Philosophy $\approx$ {Conceptual Analysis, Method of Cases, Reflective Equilibrium, Conceptual Engineering, Formal Logic, Naturalizations, Experimental Philosophy, ILP, OLP, Phenomenal Conservatism, ...}

Continental Philosophy $\approx$ {Hermeneutics, Dialectics, Material Conditions analysis, Phenomenology, Critical Theory, Deconstruction, ...}

(Neo-)Pragmatic Philosophy $\approx$ {Ironism, Quietism, Fideism, Analyzing Language Games, OLP, ...}


But the sets are vague, and nothing says debates about the sets are any good to have, as contrary to the methods themselves. While I do think Formal Logic as a method in philosophy is overwhelmingly powerful and good, where I see no reason to support Natural Language based philosophy instead. However for all other methodologies, I am unsure about it (though I suspect many of the pragmatic and continental one's as very bad in some regards). So while I will consider myself analytical for now, I do not think methodology debates on grand-scales such as between analytic, continental and pragmatic are any good.
