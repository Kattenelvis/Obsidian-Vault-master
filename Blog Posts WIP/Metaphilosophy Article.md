conceptual analysis, obsessive focus on language, questionable ways of employing intuitions

# Philosophy

In its highest generality, philosophy, science and mathematics is about arguments from premises to conclusions. This includes observation sentences. Philosophy, science, mathematics and other similar studies will be named "propositional derivative systems" to indicate their foundation in formal logic. 

To formalize this notion we fix a formal system $S$ for some language $L$ for which to formalise some argument in. The structure of $L$ can remain vague for now. It can be a propositional logic, a first order logic, second order, modal logic etc. $S$ can also remain vague, wether (under a propositional language) classical, intuitionistic, paraconsistent etc or however it deals with quantifiers, identity etc. 

In general, it will include formulas built up inductively from atomic formulas and grammatical rules, aswell as a set of inference rules. Some theory $T$ in $L$ holds the non-logical synthetic propositions of which an argument is formalized as. $T$ would then contain for instance, the axioms of $ZFC$ which are the premises in modern mathematics for its conclusions, $T$ may contain the postulates of quantum mechanics and observation sentences describing the experiments, $T$ can be Reichenbachs axiomatic formalization of special relativity, $T$ may be the list of axioms in integrated information theory, $T$ can be Spinoza's axioms or $T$ can just be a small simple argument, for instance the cosmological argument or the no miracles argument. 

As such we get a definition of philosophy as the set of all such theories
Philosophy$=_{df} \{T_1,\dots T_n\}$

Or for some arbitrary indexing set
Philosophy$=_{df} \{T_i\}_{i\in I}$

Carnap distinguishes the analytic and synthetic in a way which is not critiqued by Quine's dogmas. Whenever we have a fixed system in some language, we can take it that the tautologies are the analytic statements and anything derived from an axiom in some theory $T$ is synthetic. 

We may very well distinguish philosophy from other propositional derivational systems such as science and mathematics in that it generally lacks observation statements while also containing synthetic propositions.

Notably, by these definitions, mathematics is synthetic. Note that this might assume Hilbert's thesis, the idea that mathematics is reducible to ZFC, which is usually taken for granted but may not be the case. However, the view may assume a logicist view on mathematics, such as Hilbert's thesis. 

Note, this is not a restriction on scientific methodology. Fully formalized science is compatible with even Feyarabendian approaches to method restrictions (i.e the empty restriction). 

It might seem to assume the syntactic structure of scientific theories, though with the right ZFC axioms in conjunction with the scientific theory we could easily accommodate the semantic view aswell. And natural language is not special either, the pragmatic view can likely also be accommodated. 

But here comes the real kicker: There is no geniune division between the subjects. We have/will demonstrate how to reduce mathematical objects to cognitive phenomenology, and that this reduction entails constructivism and intuitionism. As such the propositional derivational systems can only be meaningfully reducible to sense-data, and thus "checkable from skepticism" if they reject the law of double negation (since we cannot think nor experience contradictory mathematical objects) 

I have been thinking of just how many notions this can fall under. Literature may also fall under it, though as an induction schema as we translate the piece of literature into a theory $T$. Art in general too, as we can simply formalize the experience of the art into formal phenomenology.

We also get the logical closure of $T$ as $C(T)$ which include all derivations of $T$. 


We thus get a natural history of philosophy as the adding of $T$'s
Historicism: More and more are added over time, adding to our collection of philosophies. A philosophy $T$ can be understood as adding to or negating a previous one.

Example:
Descartes:

$T=\{ \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg K(\exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$ (By modus Ponens)

Moorean Shift:

$T'=\{ K(\exists x Hand(x)), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$ (By modus tollens)



We may still be pessimists about progress, as it may turn out through the process of formalized Hermeneutics to be identical. 

Formalized Hermeneutics:
Adding propositions $T' = T\cup \{p\}$ 
Understands the whole better. 
Over time a finished formalism is done


Conceptual analysis is done withing T's which would include intuition statements (which would probably be similar to observation statements in science)

I'm not doing a rational reconstruction, or faithful reconstruction, of what mathematicians, scientists or philosophers actually do, for it is unimportant and those without proper foundations should be pointed out as having none. This is not sociology. I do not think that it's important that there just so happen to be humans who just so happen to be mathematicians, philosophers or scientists who just so happen to do things which also contradicts the philosophy presented in this article. In that case, the indivudal should be rejected or atleast it should be pointed out that they're not grounding it in phenomenal experience. It might not have been humans doing philosophy. Humans are just a mere contingency, a tiny speck in the space of possible minds. Things could have been different, and a philosophical system should ground itself only in what is completely evidently given i.e sense data. 


Meta-languages and meta-philosophy. Avoiding circularity.


Is there an explanation for why natural language is used when I'm arguing all of philosophy (but not necessarily meta-philosophy) is formal?

NP-hardness makes searching the space of possibly philosophies extremely time consuming, and has to be efficient by algorithms searching through that space in P-time, which humans seem to be decent at?

Like there's obviously a combinatorial explosion of possible philosophies

We can define positivism as the view that all propositional derivation systems are mathematical or scientific, with no extra categories. 

> For much of the history of philosophy, philosophers could not have imagined their philosophizing as separate from not only mathematics, but also the empirical sciences.

-Machery Philosophy within its proper bounds

There may be no special conceptual analysis that makes Philosophy a distinct propositional derivational system. 




There is an assumption that philosophy is to be done in natural language. I will call this the NL-assumption. I will contend that the NL-assumption is false. 
Someone [who?] has argued that the english mereologists use is not quite english. I will argue for the Formal Language assumption FL-assumption as true. Philosophy is best done in a precise way which analyzes phenomenal consciousness and builds up all concepts with phenomenal concepts as its foundation which is also first philosophy. Phenomenal Foundationalism.

This analysis of concepts is what philosophy differs from science and mathematics. 


We're not doing a rational reconstruction, we're showing what can be scrutinized by not being justified from a phenomenal basis. We show that in principle we can formalize all scientific theories (were at worst it's just a list of observation sentences).



# Brief overview

**Conceptual analysis**: **Conceptual analysis** breaks down **concepts** into (perhaps multiple) other **concepts**. Examples include knowledge as justified true belief, free will as the ability to do otherwise, and supervenience as no x change without y change. 

**Method of cases**: **Concepts** are applied to **thought experiments**, or **cases**, of which **intuitions** are elicited and informs a revision of **concepts**. This works because we are competent speakers of the language the concept is in. 

**Reflective Equilibrium**: Iterated applications of method of cases eventually yield reflective equilibrium where the general concept definitions apply to all cases. 

## Conceptual Analysis

So as part of a formal theory we may for instance include:

$Kp \leftrightarrow (Jp\wedge Bp\wedge p)$
$Sup(x,y)\leftrightarrow (\Delta y \to \Delta x)$
etc.

The idea is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a concept to apply. 


## Method of Cases
Williamsons formalization of conceptual analysis applying method of cases.

$\square (Kp \leftrightarrow JBTp)$
$\diamondsuit (\neg Kp\wedge JBTp)$

The problematic intuition of the case in the possible world where the JBT is not K.  

His argument is no different from relying on intuitions.

I reject all $T$'s of which contain intuition propositions

The long term goal according to some is to achieve a  Equilibrium, whereby one has applied conceptual analysis many times, thought through many thought experiments until all universal laws match all intuition on all cases. [[Method of Cases and Reflective Equilibrium]]


Could an ASI predict ones intuition regarding any thought experiment, and thus could in principle perfect the method of cases?

### Thought Experiments

Proof by contradictions are not inuitionistically valid. Fine Ig??

Nortons argumentative view, some claim he is vague, so I will formalize this notion: 

a thought experiment is a theory $T$.

Usually meant to show some subtheory $T_s\subset T$ is contradictory, either by elliciting intuitions (by being an intuition pump) or as is often done in science, demonstrate ways a theory is logically contradictory in some situations.

We may sometimes ellicit intuitions


## Reflective Equilibrium

Instead of just going by intuitions, we can sometimes reject intuitions, if they're for instance, not strong enough. 


Reflections on reflective equilibrium.


Not a solution, they are just as dependent on irrational intuitions as any other, and maybe accoridng to experimental philosophy (todo: check this out) that our strongest intuitions are only sometimes in agreement, and less subject to change. But where to draw the line? 



## What are intuitions really?

Formal phenomenology. E = {V, A, T,...} for visual space V auditory space A and thought space T. T is most likely reducible to V. In the book varieties of consciousness, there are two views primitivism and reductionism (and also eliminativism but let's assume that's false for thoughts). I take the reductionist route.

Why rely on the phenomenal experience of "intuition" rather than the phenomenal experiences of "regions of blue"? 

So I reject intuitions, the Ah-hah feeling, and cast skeptical reasoning towards a priori foundationalism, focuing on a empiricist foundherentism. 

Cognitive Phenomenology

## Experimental philosophy

The idea is to test intuitions on lay people. Are horribly dependent on irrational factors such as someone's sex, ethnicity or age. 

Expertise defence is a defence, there is some special skill and/or talent philosophers have which has allowed them more fine-tuned intuitions which are actually true, just like fine-calibrating a scientific instrument to get the best scientific data. 

Turns out most lay-people intuitions still apply to experts [Source]. Expert philosophers are bad at modal reasoning, if anything, mathematicians are the modal experts [Source]. Extrovert lay people are just as more likely to believe in free will than introverts as is the case for professional philosophers. 


## Conceptual Engineering as solution


Explicative Definitions however we want, as are found in our theories $T$.

Carnap
Chalmers
Machery


On a side-note, and potentially a fairly controversial one, is my view of gender. At some moments if asked what a gender is, or what a woman is or what a man is, I would try to find the optimal definition given some utilitarian calculus, which would at a minimum include transwomen as women and transmen as men as affirming their gender identity optimizes happiness related factors such as decreased suicide risk, depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms in transgender individuals. But an argument I received back was that this is a fallacy, namely the moralistic fallacy. However, it is clear to me now that since gender is a constructed concept, we can construct them however we like, including optimizing the state of the world given some decision theoretic or moral system.

We can do the same for race and mental illnesses. 


We will redefine all concepts to be reducible to sense-experience, or as long descriptions of sense data, as this serves our goal of being robust against skeptical problems. 

I also think that typically, the main reason there's disagreement is philosophy is because different agents hold slightly different unclarified folk-concepts. It's typically when concepts are clarified, as they are in the sciences, that agreement is reached, for the conceptual constructions are standardizes between individuals. I think the same does happen in philosophy a lot more often than people give credit for.


One problem purpoerted by Carnap's is taht it doens't formalize the explicatum the best [sourc€] takes faoucaldian geneaology to be optimal. I say NO or atleast maybe not for some set of concepts. A propoer logical formalism would be


# Naturalizations

Consciousness Research and AI research is the best bet we have. 

A real case against the rationality of working on most issues in philosophy: AI may be able to do it for us in the future

Science is like philosophy anyways, but with observation sentences as premises. 

IIT vs GWT as the two competing models of consciousness.

But let's not take it too far.

## Mental States and Folk Psychology

Naturalizations are sometimes eliminative about folk psychological states

Circularity without it?
Yet kinda bad and can be eliminated? Not sure tbh... Ask Youv

## The case for Narrow content

Phenomenal experience, see later, is fundamental. We don't hold representations that are wide in the environment. All contents in this article are narrow, as I've experienced them before. 

Since we've already discussed that intuitions and method of cases doesn't work, we can exclude arguments such as twin earth or gödel-schmitt cases immediately. We can still use them as intuition pumps, and explain narrow content.

In the twin earth thought experiment, twin earth has something like water, but is a posteriori identical to XYZ instead of water. We presume that H2O $\neq$ XYZ. The narrow, phenomenal content of water is the color of water, the way it sounds, feels and so on. The idea is that Twin Earth Water is by narrow, phenomenal content identical to Earth Water, but it's "intuitively false" that they would have identical content. I reject the intuition. 

Content construed narrowly allows for much better theorizing about mental states, is the only one important for folk psychology, is more coherent with Chomskyian I-language and E-language etc.



Putnam is utterly wrong. We have predictive world models of VR games. It can be the same in the world. A tree having properties $P_1,...P_n$ can be true in a virtual world just as well, with the added property of $P_{n+1}=$ "is digital". 


# Language


With the rise of Ideal language philosophy and Ordinary Language philosophy, no more substantive claims. 

Substantive/Naturalized philosophy can make comeback. Philosophy is more than no substantial claims. Maybe idk... 

Ideal language vs Ordinary article here, all of philosophy would then be analytic.

As such I think of a combination of ideal and substantive philosophy, and a rejection of ordinary language. 

Chomsky I-language and E-language. Rejecting the private language argument. 

Rejecting Kripkenstein. 


Semantic Phenomenalism


![[Frame 4.png]]

Skeptical worries of our system being inconsistent can be solved in two ways: Either we prove the consistency within the system, we accept paraconsistency. We could also simply accept that an inconsistency is possible, which is what most mathematicians have done with ZFC.

We can almost certiantly say natural language is inconsistent. We can prove the consistency of formal systems with sufficient arithmetic only from stronger systems which retain sufficient arithmetic. What remains are a set of small languages which can define their own truth predicate and prove their own consistency, such as Pressburger Arithmetic.  

To truly stave it off, then, we may have to look into formalizing our philosophical system within a system which cannot express sufficient arithmetic, which can be done in many ways.

A possible objection is that a philosophical theory $T$ would include some kind of metaphysics, some kind of description of the world. Hence cannot predict that there would exist systems such as Peano Arithmetic. However Max Tegmark argues against this view:

> "Even a world corresponding to a Gödel-complete mathematical structure could in could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about Gödel-incomplete mathematics, just as [finite-state digital computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "Turing machine") can prove certain theorems about Gödel-incomplete formal systems like [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic "Peano arithmetic")."



Conlangs demonstrate that natural languages are not all they're painted to be, and we'd be so much freer if we used a larger range of possible languages. 

# Philosophical progress

Not quite true. But lack of it in some fields is cause for concern? Ehhh I guess lack of progress is only a concern whenever there is no finished consensus view that finishes in the establishment of something.

Add that article here

LLM's for progress?


With our formalisation we can now posit some progress. It's about the addition of systems $T$.  

Yet another object-level debate that's trivial after we've applied conceptual engineering and empirical evidence. There are multiple different notions of progress [source] We find that progress in the sense of adding more texts and publishing more papers that it's uncontroversial. By other metric it's also uncontroversial whether there's progress or not. 


# Common sense Philosophy

Radically relative
Experimental philosophy

(Is PC even comon sense or smth else?)
Phenomenal Conservatism: With the unreliance of intuitions, there's no reason so support our initial beliefs until defeaters show up or anything like that

I think it clicked: Every appearance is justificatory in some way. I have to agree with this. They are all observation sentences. There's no need to privilege different appearances. 

We could be radically wrong
Reid, who supported Common Sense philosophy does also take it that we *could* be radically wrong (fallibilism).


Moore and why the hand shifting argument doesn't work

# Ontological commitment
Quine on what there is

Quinean commitments on reality as it is, leads to arguments about the existence of mountains. Mereological argument:

$T=\{$Mountains are composites, No composites exist$\}$

So a consequence of this theory in a system which allows modus ponens yields "There are no mountains". 

"To be is to be a value of a quantifier"

I will hence forth reject that any $T$ has priviliged access to reality and is the true nature of it. I adopt a Carnapian view that existence just follows trivially from a theory. Let's say we formalize geology axiomatically as $G$ in some formal system. It's likely a consequence of $G$ that mountains exist. Geologists may not use $G$ though, as it may turn out a better theory for their goals is $G'$ which doesn't have that implication



# Skeptical problems

Skepticism taken seriously. Cartesian skepticism.

First philosophy: There exists experience. 
This could perhaps be done via formal systems [[3. Formal Phenomenology]]
[[the other 2]]

Trillemma
Foundherentism.
I take it that sense-data is not an intuition. An red region R in visual space V is not an intuition, and forms a sortoff basic belief (with some complications I will get too). With empiricist foundationalism or empiricist foundherentism, there is no knowledge which is based on intuitions, but only in lists of sense-data

The issue is the myth of the given, which is remedied with a foundherentist system, developed by Haack and mathematically formalized by Thagard. There is a coherence relation between theoretical propositions, formalised in logical systems (all of which is definitional and explicative, no intuitions are ever used for any of the inference rules)

There are two kinds of justification, S-justification and C-justification, depending on if sense data is justifying a theory or if theories are justifying sense-data. But foundherentism takes a special priviliged role to sense data (though tbh I think she doesn't use the term 'sense data' so this might be a misscharacterization) because sense data is what upholds something which would otherwise be fully coherentist, and thus the typical problems of coherentism which includes that a coherent set of propositions could just be fictional

coherence function on a set of propositions and coherence relations, aswell as 5 optimization algorithms that try to maximise which propositions to put in a set to maximise coherence. Including a formalism of Haacks work


The problem of Beginning: Phenomenal Experience. Relevant to sceptical scenarios. I think sceptical scenarios are relevant and have not really been defeated. I think a philosophy which begins by positing external world objects will not be adequate to survive external world scepticism. As such I support philosophies which are robust to external world scepticism.



Problem of the criterion: How do we justify the criterions of justification? I don't know...


The beginning of philosophy is in phenomenal consciousness, the beginning is solved this way. If everything reduces to phenomenal consciousness, including thought itself, we're golden. 



# No meta-philosophy

Only really philosophy of philosophy. It's just a set of object level debates of which is typically conceived to have a lot of importance for many other branches, which is already the case within many branches. As a consequence one cannot be "anti-philosophy" without making atleast one philosophical proposition or argument. 

If philosophy is "valuable" is just an object level proposition that follows trivially from a theory of value or decision theory $T$. 

We thus get philosophical knowledge. Knowing a system $T$. Follows trivially from epistemological theories $T$ what counts as knowledge or not, just like philosophical value.

Likewise, debates about methodologies in for instance, analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatic philosophy all turn out to be some set of mostly object-level debates. 

Analytic Philosophy $\approx$ {Conceptual Analysis, Method of Cases, Reflective Equilibrium, Conceptual Engineering, Formal Logic, Naturalizations, Experimental Philosophy, ILP, OLP, Phenomenal Conservatism, ...}

Continental Philosophy $\approx$ {Hermeneutics, Dialectics, Material Conditions analysis, Phenomenology, Critical Theory, Deconstruction, ...}

(Neo-)Pragmatic Philosophy $\approx$ {Ironism, Quietism, Fideism, Analyzing Language Games, OLP, ...}

Scholastic Philosophy $\approx$ {Natural Theology, Negative Theology, Revelation, ...}


But the sets are vague, and nothing says debates about the sets are any good to have, as contrary to the methods themselves. While I do think Formal Logic as a method in philosophy is overwhelmingly powerful and good, where I see no reason to support Natural Language based philosophy instead. However for all other methodologies, I am unsure about it (though I suspect many of the pragmatic and continental one's as very bad in some regards). So while I will consider myself analytical for now, I do not think methodology debates on grand-scales such as between analytic, continental and pragmatic are any good. 




# Innateness of Concepts, conceptual reduction


Reducing all concepts to a small set of concepts in phenomenal consciousness. Other concepts may exist, but we're not interested in them.

Fodor's view. It could be the case that there are innate concepts, in the sense of 


Reduction of logical concepts? A sense data for instance: Either region A is blue or it is not the case that region A is blue. By forbidding the empty mind, we can always ensure that such an region A exists (which we already do in finitist set theory). 

Even if the traditional approach of reducing all concepts failed, we can consider that the only one's that are robust against external world skepticism, useful for that goal, then we're golden (though I'd have a hard time seeing how anything could not be reduced to experience). 

Carnap:
In the case of many words, specifically in the case of the overwhelming majority of scientific words, it is possible to specify their meaning by reduction to other words ("constitution," definition). E.g., "'arthropodes' are animals with segmented bodies and jointed legs." .... In this way every word of the language is reduced to other words and finally to the words which occur in the so-called "observation sentences" or "protocol sentences."13

With our view on cognitive phenomenology, we should accept this even for logical conepts. A rational being may need to be bootstrapped with some concepts to develop new one, some critical mass of concepts needed for human-level concept understand and concept making. 


We keep the traditional view of concepts, we can have a plurality of definitions, and definitions are described in formal systems given the goals of the system. 



Example of conceptual reduction:

Time in the GIF of changing blue to red and back

CHANGE = MEMORY OF X CURRENTLY Y

MEMORY is an imaginative process [source], and hence experiential. Mental image of blue, or atleast some semantic information, about past state of the pixel. 

One example in one paper was LIE into 4 other concepts find it and try to do it on the other 4



Chomsky and Fodor can be right in that we may still be bootrapped as cognitive agents with certain concepts to which learn more concepts. But afterwards we can reduce them all to experiences anyways. Including logical concepts.

Play a game with people: Ask them to give you a concept and see if you can reduce it.
