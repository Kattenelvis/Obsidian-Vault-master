# Formal Meta-Philosophy

# Propositional Derivational Systems

In its highest generality, philosophy, science and mathematics is about arguments from premises to conclusions. This includes observation sentences. Philosophy, science, mathematics and other similar studies will be named "propositional derivative systems" to indicate their foundation in formal logic. 

To formalize this notion we fix a formal system $S$ for some language $L$ for which to formalize some argument in. The structure of $L$ can remain vague for now. It can be the languages for propositional logic, a first order logic, second order, modal logic etc. $S$ can also remain vague, whether (under a propositional language) classical, intuitionistic, paraconsistent etc. or however it deals with quantifiers, identity etc. This allows us to not accidentally include hidden assumptions made in applying formal systems to theories., such as for instance, non-Meinongian quantification in standard first order logic (which could in principle be remedied by adding an existence predicate [Nonexistent Objects (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/#ConcNoneObje)). 

In general, it will include formulas built up inductively from atomic formulas and grammatical rules, aswell as a set of inference rules. Some theory $T$ in $S$ holds the non-logical axioms of which an argument is formalized as. $T$ would then contain for instance, the axioms of $ZFC$ which are the premises of the conclusions in classical mathematics, $T$ may contain the postulates of quantum mechanics and observation sentences describing the experiments, $T$ can be Reichenbach's axiomatic formalization of special relativity, $T$ may be the list of axioms in integrated information theory, $T$ can be Spinoza's axioms or $T$ can just be a small simple argument, for instance the cosmological argument or the no miracles argument. 

We also get the logical closure of $T$ as $C(T)$ which include all derivations of $T$ given the inference rules in $S$ that $T$ is in. 

We get a definition of philosophy as the set of all such theories
Philosophy$=_{df} \{T_1,\dots T_n\}$

Or for some arbitrary indexing set, for instance if there's some one-to-one mapping from some infinite cardinal to possible theories in all languages and systems:

Philosophy$=_{df} \{T_i\}_{i\in I}$

Carnap distinguishes the analytic and synthetic in a way which is not critiqued by Quine's dogmas. Whenever we have a fixed system in some language, we can take it that the tautologies are the analytic statements and anything derived from an axiom in some theory $T$ is synthetic. 

We may distinguish philosophy from other propositional derivational systems such as science and mathematics in that it generally lacks observation statements while also containing synthetic propositions.

Notably, by these definitions, mathematics is synthetic. Note that this might assume Hilbert's thesis, the idea that mathematics is reducible to ZFC, which is usually taken for granted but may not be the case. However, the view may assume a logicist view on mathematics, nor Hilbert's thesis. 

Note also that for scientific theories, it is not a restriction on scientific methodology. Fully formalized science is compatible with even Feyarabendian approaches to method restrictions (i.e the empty restriction) so long as theories are formalized. It might then seem to assume the syntactic structure of scientific theories, though with the right ZFC axioms in conjunction with the scientific theory we could easily accommodate the semantic view aswell, and all modern mathematics. Sometimes axiomatizations may require $S=$ second order logic or higher. Natural language is not special, the pragmatic account of scientific theories can likely also be accommodated. 

I will argue that there is no genuine division between the propositional derivational systems science, mathematics and philosophy. Mathematical objects reduce to cognitive phenomenology. As such the propositional derivational systems can only be meaningfully reducible to sense-data, and thus "checkable from skepticism" if they reject the law of double negation (since we cannot think nor experience contradictory mathematical objects) 


Inspired by Sneed's project, We can define a natural history of certain propositional derivational systems as the adding of $T$'s 

Historicism: More and more are added over time, adding to our collection of philosophies. A philosophy $T$ can be understood as adding to or negating a previous one. A full definition can be found in [structuralism in physics SEP].

Example for a philosophy themed propositional derivational system:

Descartes:

$T=\{ \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg K(\exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$ (By modus Ponens)

Moorean Shift:

$T'=\{ K(\exists x Hand(x)), \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x)\to \neg K(\exists x Hand(x)) \}$

$\{\neg \diamondsuit\neg \exists x Hand(x))\}\in C(T)$ (By modus tollens)

I have been thinking of just how many notions this can fall under. Literature may also fall under it, though as an induction schema as we translate the piece of literature into a theory $T$. Art in general too, as we can simply formalize the experience of the art into formal phenomenology. Application areas are likely limited, though could be used to find inconsistencies in worldbuilding (however for sufficiently long novels this becomes untenable due to the exponential time complexity of derivational algorithms that check every consequence, not to mention possible incompleteness if the novel can derive sufficient arithmetic). It's worth noting that this may not be useful, even if it possible to do. But for my project it suffices that it's in principle possible, not whether it's useful for applications. 

It may be applicable to a kind of formalized Hermeneutics, where over time a finished formalism is done:
Adding propositions $T' = T\cup \{p\}$ 
Removing contradictions: $T' = T / \{p\} \cup \{\neg p\}$
Etc.

It's worth noting that I'm not doing a rational reconstruction, or faithful reconstruction, of what mathematicians, scientists or philosophers actually do, for it is unimportant and those without proper foundations should be pointed out as having none. This is not sociology. I do not think that it's important that there just so happen to be humans who just so happen to be mathematicians, philosophers or scientists who just so happen to do things which also contradicts the philosophy presented in this article. In that case, the individual should be rejected or atleast it should be pointed out that they're not grounding it in phenomenal experience. It might not have been humans doing philosophy. Humans are just a mere contingency, a tiny speck in the space of possible minds. Things could have been different, and a philosophical system should ground itself only in what is completely evidently given i.e sense data. 

Some may wonder if there is there an explanation for why natural language is used in philosophy at all? NP-hardness makes searching the space of possibly philosophies extremely time consuming, and has to be efficient by algorithms searching through that space in P-time, which humans seem to be decent at? There's obviously a combinatorial explosion of possible philosophies, and diminishing the search space is efficient and useful. There is an assumption that philosophy is to be done in natural language. I will call this the NL-assumption. I will contend that the NL-assumption is false. 

We can define positivism as the view that all propositional derivation systems are mathematical or scientific, with no extra categories. But how could philosophy differ if it does? As machery says:

> For much of the history of philosophy, philosophers could not have imagined their philosophizing as separate from not only mathematics, but also the empirical sciences.

-Machery Philosophy within its proper bounds

This analysis of concepts could be what philosophy differs from science and mathematics. Conceptual analysis is done withing T's which would include intuition statements (which would probably be similar to observation statements in science). There may be no special conceptual analysis that makes Philosophy a distinct propositional derivational system. 

Someone [who?] has argued that the english mereologists use is not quite english. I will argue for the Formal Language assumption FL-assumption as true. I would like to say in addition that philosophy is best done in a precise way which analyzes phenomenal consciousness and builds up all concepts with phenomenal concepts as its foundation which is also first philosophy, some kind of Empiricist Foundationalism.

# Do concepts makes philosophy different?

Conceptual analysis is a possible hypothesis on what makes philosophy different from other PDS. How can we characterize concepts, and is it actually different from science?

**Conceptual analysis**: Conceptual analysis breaks down **concepts** into (perhaps multiple) other **concepts**. Examples include knowledge as justified true belief, free will as the ability to do otherwise, or supervenience as no x change without y change. As part of a formal theory we may for instance include:

$Kp \leftrightarrow (Jp\wedge Bp\wedge p)$
$Willed(x)\rightarrow\diamondsuit Willed(\neg x)$
etc.

The idea is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a concept to apply, the idea is then to find counter-examples until one has a concept which covers all instances and leaves no counter-examples. This is known as the **Method of cases**: **Concepts** are applied to **thought experiments**, or **cases**, of which **intuitions** are elicited and informs a revision of **concepts**. According to some defenders of the method of cases. this works because we are competent speakers of the language the concept is in. 

Williamsons formalization of conceptual analysis applying method of cases applying alethic modal logic in the following way for the knowledge concept, with the possibility of Gettier cases:

$\square (Kp \leftrightarrow JBTp)$
$\diamondsuit (\neg Kp\wedge JBTp)$

The problematic intuition of the case in the possible world where the JBT is not K, i.e Gettier worlds. As such, the PDS generated from both statement at once must be contradictory. One can give up one of the statements, according to the method of cases, one always gives up the general rule. But there is an alternative.

**Reflective Equilibrium**: Iterated applications of method of cases eventually yield reflective equilibrium where the general concept definitions apply to all cases. Instead of just going by intuitions, we can sometimes reject intuitions, if they're for instance, not strong enough. The long term goal according to some is to achieve a  Equilibrium, whereby one has applied conceptual analysis many times, thought through many thought experiments until all universal laws match all intuition on all cases. [[Method of Cases and Reflective Equilibrium]]

## Experimental philosophy

The idea is to test intuitions on lay people. Are horribly dependent on irrational factors such as someone's sex, ethnicity or age. While I said I wasn't going to do sociology. hmm wait.

Expertise defense states that there exists some special skill and/or talent philosophers have which has allowed them more fine-tuned intuitions which are actually true, just like fine-calibrating a scientific instrument to get the best scientific data. 

Turns out most lay-people intuitions still apply to experts [Source]. Expert philosophers are bad at modal reasoning, if anything, mathematicians are the modal experts [Source]. Extrovert lay people are just as more likely to believe in free will than introverts as is the case for professional philosophers. 



## Conceptual Engineering, Method of Cases 2.0 and Familiar Resemblance

I think the earlier mentioned methods is "flawed", even though it is perfectly compatible as a PDS. Instead I will defend explicative definitions given our goals, in our theories $T$.

On a side-note, and potentially a fairly controversial one, is my view of gender. At some moments if asked what a gender is, or what a woman is or what a man is, I would try to find the optimal definition given some utilitarian calculus, which would at a minimum include transwomen as women and transmen as men as affirming their gender identity optimizes happiness related factors such as decreased suicide risk, depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms in transgender individuals. But an argument I received back was that this is a fallacy, namely the moralistic fallacy. However, it is clear to me now that since gender is a constructed concept, we can construct them however we like, including optimizing the state of the world given some decision theoretic or moral system. We can do the same for race and mental illnesses. 

One could explicate all concepts to be reducible to sense-experience, or as long descriptions of sense data, as this serves our goal of being robust against skeptical problems. 

I also think that typically, the main reason there's disagreement is philosophy is because different agents hold slightly different unclarified folk-concepts. It's typically when concepts are clarified, observation sentences based on those concepts are derived and checked or falsified, as they are in the sciences, that agreement is reached. The conceptual constructions are standardized between individuals. I think the same does happen in philosophy a lot more often than people give credit for.

In this regard, philosophical PDS it's no different from scientific PDS.

Some words on the familiar resemblance theory of concepts: 
It stanky


Carnap
Chalmers
Machery


# Skeptical problems

Maybe philosophy differs in skeptical problems. Scientific and mathematical theories might in principle include assumptions about knowledge, or atleast some kind of constructed concept that's similar to knowledge. Is this what separate philosophical PDS from other PDS? 

To figure out optimal conceptual constructions within skepticism, it's worth setting a goal first. The goal I posit here is to build robustness against skepticism. I believe it is uncontroversial that what I argue will be the best approach for that goal. 

Firstly, skepticism taken seriously. We take it to be a genuinely serious case that we really could be brains in a vat, deceived by demons and so on. We can even formulate probabilistic arguments for Boltzmann brains and the Simulation Hypothesis. However I will argue that this doesn't quite work. 

The demon problem (including the new one) presupposes modal knowledge of possibilities. Keep in mind, so does the "common sense" i.e "the possibility of the existence of the external world basically as our folk theories posit it is" too. We cannot state any of them are possible by certainty. But we can state that a phenomenal experience is accessible, hence is. We must begin with the phenomenal experience as atleast partially a foundation. 

Not to mention that we haven't constructed knowledge yet. 

I will however take the approach that phenomenal consciousness is a kind of given, and is the first to be analyzed. This is similar to what Husserl argued [source].  I take the approach that the problem of beginning [source] can be solved this way. 

Phenomenal Justificatory Egalitarianism: Inspired by Phenomenal Conservativism, it states that we have no reason to take some regions of phenomenal experience as constituting special justification. This includes cognitive phenomenology. 

I take it that sense-data is not an intuition. An red region R in visual space V is not an intuition, and forms a sortoff basic belief (with some complications I will get too). With empiricist foundationalism or empiricist foundherentism, there is no knowledge which is based on intuitions, but only in lists of sense-data

The issue is the myth of the given, which is remedied with a foundherentist system, developed by Haack and mathematically formalized by Thagard. There is a coherence relation between theoretical propositions, formalized in logical systems (all of which is definitional and explicative, no intuitions are ever used for any of the inference rules)

There are two kinds of justification, S-justification and C-justification, depending on if sense data is justifying a theory or if theories are justifying sense-data. But foundherentism takes a special privileged role to sense data (though tbh I think she doesn't use the term 'sense data' so this might be a mischaracterization) because sense data is what upholds something which would otherwise be fully Coherentism, and thus the typical problems of Coherentism which includes that a coherent set of propositions could just be fictional.

Coherence function on a set of propositions and coherence relations, aswell as 5 optimization algorithms that try to maximize which propositions to put in a set to maximize coherence. Including a formalism of Haacks work

Problem of the criterion: How do we justify the criterions of justification? I don't know...

As part of the goal, concepts will be constructed grounded in sense-data, just as in Carnap's aufbau. This will make the theory robust against external world skepticism, and makes sure that the account holds no metaphysical assumptions (and I really mean none, we might get back to this). Theories $T$ as part of PDS's may include any quantification realm, but never committed to it. 

Quinean commitments on reality as it is, leads to arguments about the existence of mountains. Mereological argument:

$T=\{$Mountains are composites, No composites exist$\}$

So a consequence of this theory in a system which allows modus ponens yields "There are no mountains". 

"To be is to be a value of a quantifier"

I will hence forth reject that any $T$ has privileged access to reality and is the true nature of it. I adopt a Carnapian view that existence just follows trivially from a theory. Let's say we formalize geology axiomatically as $G$ in some formal system. It's likely a consequence of $G$ that mountains exist. Geologists may not use $G$ though, as it may turn out a better theory for their goals is $G'$ which doesn't have that implication

# The case for Narrow content

Phenomenal experience, see later, is fundamental. I will advocate for a theory which holds that we don't hold representations that are wide in the environment, as our goal of robustness against skepticism would fail otherwise. All contents in this article are narrow, as I've experienced them before. 

Since we've already discussed that intuitions and method of cases doesn't work, we can exclude arguments such as twin earth or gödel-schmitt cases immediately. We can still use them as intuition pumps, and explain narrow content.

In the twin earth thought experiment, twin earth has something like water, but is a posteriori identical to XYZ instead of water. We presume that H2O $\neq$ XYZ. The narrow, phenomenal content of water is the color of water, the way it sounds, feels and so on. The idea is that Twin Earth Water is by narrow, phenomenal content identical to Earth Water, but it's "intuitively false" that they would have identical content. I reject the intuition. 

Content construed narrowly allows for much better theorizing about mental states, is the only one important for folk psychology, is more coherent with Chomskyian I-language and E-language etc.

Putnam is utterly wrong. We have predictive world models of VR games. It can be the same in the world. A tree having properties $P_1,...P_n$ can be true in a virtual world just as well, with the added property of $P_{n+1}=$ "is digital". 

PIT, one-to-one mappings, cognitive phenomenology.

In the end, we can just aswell be a brain in a vat, and perfectly have knowledge regardless, from the experiences in the vat. 

## Cognitive Phenomenology

Something very many people are wrong about, especially rationalists, is what thoughts are. Cognitive Phenomenology is the analysis of what it is like to experience thoughts. So much confusion has arisen from the belief that thoughts are different from other experiences. 

Reductionism

Primitivism

Phenomenal contrast cases
[Phenomenal Intentionality (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenal-intentionality/)

So in that case, mental content is nothing above and beyond their phenomenal content, i.e mental imagery, inner voice and sensations of ah-hah pleasures. We engineer the concept so as to exclude the many-to-one mappings and instead posit a one-to-one mapping, or even identity relation, between phenomenal content and mental content. 

$T_1 = M_1, T_2=M_2, ..., T_n=M_n$

Arguing for Reductionism

Mental images and inner thoughts, people with aphantasia have predisposition to write it down, hence an experience. There are reasons to believe that there's no true aphantasiac, they usually just lack one or the other. 

Conjecture: There exists $a\subset A$ and $v\subset V$, such that $T=\{a,v\}$


An objection may be the "Ah-Hah!" Experience that some have reported[source]. I however argue the following:

Conjecture: There exists $a\subset A$, $v\subset V$ and $p\subset P$ , such that $Ahhah! = \{v,a,p\}$



Strawson
> To deny this [cognitive phenomenology], one must hold that the total lifelong character of our lived experience—everything that life is to us experientially—consists entirely of bare or pure sensation or feeling of one kind or another. It must, for example, be false to say that anguish at someone’s death includes _conscious comprehending believing entertaining_ of the proposition that he is dead. (Strawson 2011a: 295, italics in original)

In a similar vein, Kriegel writes:

> For my part, I am persuaded of the existence of cognitive experience […] most vividly by something like everyday experiential overwhelm: it simply seems that my inner life is much more interesting to me than it would be if my conscious experience consisted merely in perceptual experiences. (Kriegel 2011a: 50)

The thought of a green patch and a green patch are not different, it has been a long standing conceptual confusion that they're different. It has also been purported to have different justificatory power, but by the phenomenal egalitarian principle, it would not be the case. They may be different justificatory for different theories but that's it. 


We will come further with philosophy if we recognize thought as indistinct from sight and hearing. 

We can now go back to intuitions from our previous discussion, now that we can formalize what they are.

Formal phenomenology. E = {V, A, T,...} for visual space V auditory space A and thought space T. T is most likely reducible to V. In the book varieties of consciousness, there are two views primitivism and reductionism (and also eliminativism but let's assume that's false for thoughts). I take the reductionist route.

Why rely on the phenomenal experience of "intuition" rather than the phenomenal experiences of "regions of blue"? 

So I reject intuitions, the Ah-hah feeling, and cast skeptical reasoning towards a priori foundationalism, focuing on a empiricist foundherentism. 



## Innateness of Concepts, conceptual reduction


Reducing all concepts to a small set of concepts in phenomenal consciousness. Other concepts may exist, but we're not interested in them.

Fodor's view. It could be the case that there are innate concepts, in the sense of 


Reduction of logical concepts? A sense data for instance: Either region A is blue or it is not the case that region A is blue. By forbidding the empty mind, we can always ensure that such an region A exists (which we already do in finitist set theory). 

Even if the traditional approach of reducing all concepts failed, we can consider that the only one's that are robust against external world skepticism, useful for that goal, then we're golden (though I'd have a hard time seeing how anything could not be reduced to experience). 

Carnap:
In the case of many words, specifically in the case of the overwhelming majority of scientific words, it is possible to specify their meaning by reduction to other words ("constitution," definition). E.g., "'arthropodes' are animals with segmented bodies and jointed legs." .... In this way every word of the language is reduced to other words and finally to the words which occur in the so-called "observation sentences" or "protocol sentences."13

With our view on cognitive phenomenology, we should accept this even for logical conepts. A rational being may need to be bootstrapped with some concepts to develop new one, some critical mass of concepts needed for human-level concept understand and concept making. 


We keep the traditional view of concepts, we can have a plurality of definitions, and definitions are described in formal systems given the goals of the system. 



Example of conceptual reduction:

Time in the GIF of changing blue to red and back

CHANGE = MEMORY OF X CURRENTLY Y

MEMORY is an imaginative process [source], and hence experiential. Mental image of blue, or atleast some semantic information, about past state of the pixel. 

One example in one paper was LIE into 4 other concepts find it and try to do it on the other 4



Chomsky and Fodor can be right in that we may still be bootrapped as cognitive agents with certain concepts to which learn more concepts. But afterwards we can reduce them all to experiences anyways. Including logical concepts.

Play a game with people: Ask them to give you a concept and see if you can reduce it.


John Locke:
> I think I need not go any farther in the Analysis of that complex Idea, we call a Lye: What I have said is enough to shew, that it is made up of simple Ideas: And it could not but be an offensive tediousness to my Reader, to trouble him with a more minute enumeration of every particular simple Idea, that goes into this complex one; which, from what has been said, he cannot but be able to make out to himself.


> Unfortunately, it is all but obvious how to complete the analysis, breaking the concept down into simple, sensory components. As several authors have observed (Armstrong et. al. 1983 [chapter 10], Fodor 1981), it isn't even clear that definitions such as the one suggested by Locke bring us any closer to the level of sensory concepts than the concept under analysis. Are the concepts SPEAKER, AFFIRMATION, NEGATION, or STANDING FOR really any closer to the sensory level than the concept LIE?

Let's play the game!

$$Sp(a)\leftrightarrow \diamondsuit\exists p Ut(a,p)$$ Where $Ut$ is the "Utters" predicate. Utterance is perception of sound in a certain way, which reduces to sounds and thoughts and we've shown how thoughts are reducible to audio and sounds. 

Descriptions are generic, but there can be a many-to-one function from content to phenomenal experience [[Phenomenal Intentionality (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenal-intentionality/#many-one)]

While we could play the game of attempting to find the definition for it which eventually reduces down to phenomenal experience, we can instead focus on building them bottom-up. This may mean we leave out some everyday concepts and that the new concepts don't align up with folk concepts. We won't necessary get anywhere otherwise, for people's folk concepts differs, hence the reduction to experience (not to mention the possibility of inverse qualia, meaning that descriptions of experience could differ in ways that cannot be properly explicated by individual experiences). For instance, in the reduction of speaker in my example above, someone you reading this may have alternative intutions over whether this is the case, and perhaps come up with some "counter-intuition" to it. I argue that this is fine, you have $Sp_2(a)$, a different speaker concept which can be reduced to concepts about phenomenal experience like the rest. 


If you come up with any concept you think can't be reduced, comment it below and I'll try to reduce it the best I can.


A problem with continental philosophy is that they often run around in conceptual circles, with no foundation in experience. A skeptic could thus challenge the foundation of such a concept. 




Some say science may involve public objects, but there are no truly public objects. One can experience $E$, form the belief that $E$ applies to concept "Human pointing at a dial which reads 23.4" and conclude that "public object" is somehow reducible to this. But I'm positing that the idea it has to be external is wrong. The best hypothesis is that two human-like consciousnesses $E_1\in E$ and $E_2\in E$, have some subset $O_1\subset E_1$ and $O_2\subset E_2$. 

The possibility of semi-public objects are worth considering. Imagine for instance, three people of which one is colorblind looking at a 3 that the color blind person cannot see. Sometimes paranormal stuff where only some people see them can be considered semi-public, but that might be for other reasons. 



# Language

The formalism assumption vs Natural language assumption.

With the rise of Ideal language philosophy and Ordinary Language philosophy, no more substantive claims. 

Substantive/Naturalized philosophy can make comeback. Philosophy is more than no substantial claims. Maybe idk... 

Ideal language vs Ordinary article here, all of philosophy would then be analytic.

As such I think of a combination of ideal and substantive philosophy, and a rejection of ordinary language. 

Chomsky I-language and E-language. Rejecting the private language argument. 

Rejecting Kripkenstein. 


Semantic Phenomenalism


![[Frame 4.png]]

Skeptical worries of our system being inconsistent can be solved in two ways: Either we prove the consistency within the system, we accept paraconsistency. We could also simply accept that an inconsistency is possible, which is what most mathematicians have done with ZFC.

A skeptic may ask if the philosophical system is self-consitent. 

We can almost certiantly say natural language is inconsistent. We can prove the consistency of formal systems with sufficient arithmetic only from stronger systems which retain sufficient arithmetic. What remains are a set of small languages which can define their own truth predicate and prove their own consistency, such as Pressburger Arithmetic.  

To truly stave it off, then, we may have to look into formalizing our philosophical system within a system which cannot express sufficient arithmetic, which can be done in many ways.

A possible objection is that a philosophical theory $T$ would include some kind of metaphysics, some kind of description of the world. Hence cannot predict that there would exist systems such as Peano Arithmetic. However Max Tegmark argues against this view:

> "Even a world corresponding to a Gödel-complete mathematical structure could in could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about Gödel-incomplete mathematics, just as [finite-state digital computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "Turing machine") can prove certain theorems about Gödel-incomplete formal systems like [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic "Peano arithmetic")."



Conlangs demonstrate that natural languages are not all they're painted to be, and we'd be so much freer if we used a larger range of possible languages. 


PDS's can thus be completely self-contained, without reference to the larger project. Those languages can be built up from the inside, without a meta language. 



So in a sense, philosophy is a highly technical branch of STEM. I condemn the rest as semi-philosophy, or semi-formal philosophy.

# Others

let it suffice to say that Rudolf Carnap’s Der logische Aufbau der Welt is like a breath of fresh air and that it is a paradigm case example of what philosophy should be like in the future. Indeed, this is my prediction: 80 years from now no philosopher will get away with doing philosophy without logical and mathematical means; it would be like doing modern theoretical physics without mathematics. There will be no trivial arguments, no hidden assumptions, no talking at cross purposes. Philosophy will be done in the way in which this young German does it, for it is the only way in which philosophy will make progress. I hear you say But there is no progress in philosophy—if only Carnap’s book had come out 80 years earlier…'




## Common sense Philosophy

Radically relative
Experimental philosophy

(Is PC even comon sense or smth else?)
Phenomenal Conservatism: With the unreliance of intuitions, there's no reason so support our initial beliefs until defeaters show up or anything like that

I think it clicked: Every appearance is justificatory in some way. I have to agree with this. They are all observation sentences. There's no need to privilege different appearances. 

We could be radically wrong
Reid, who supported Common Sense philosophy does also take it that we *could* be radically wrong (fallibilism).


Moore and why the hand shifting argument doesn't work


# Naturalizations

Consciousness Research and AI research is the best bet we have. 

A real case against the rationality of working on most issues in philosophy: AI may be able to do it for us in the future

Science is like philosophy anyways, but with observation sentences as premises. 

IIT vs GWT as the two competing models of consciousness.

But let's not take it too far.


Naturalizations are sometimes eliminative about folk psychological states

Circularity without it?
Yet kinda bad and can be eliminated? Not sure tbh... Ask Youv




# Philosophical progress

Not quite true. But lack of it in some fields is cause for concern? Ehhh I guess lack of progress is only a concern whenever there is no finished consensus view that finishes in the establishment of something.

Add that article here

LLM's for progress?


With our formalisation we can now posit some progress. It's about the addition of systems $T$.  

Yet another object-level debate that's trivial after we've applied conceptual engineering and empirical evidence. There are multiple different notions of progress [source] We find that progress in the sense of adding more texts and publishing more papers that it's uncontroversial. By other metric it's also uncontroversial whether there's progress or not. 



# No meta-philosophy

Only really philosophy of philosophy. It's just a set of object level debates of which is typically conceived to have a lot of importance for many other branches, which is already the case within many branches. As a consequence one cannot be "anti-philosophy" without making atleast one philosophical proposition or argument. 

If philosophy is "valuable" is just an object level proposition that follows trivially from a theory of value or decision theory $T$. 

We thus get philosophical knowledge. Knowing a system $T$. Follows trivially from epistemological theories $T$ what counts as knowledge or not, just like philosophical value.

Likewise, debates about methodologies in for instance, analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatic philosophy all turn out to be some set of mostly object-level debates. 

Analytic Philosophy $\approx$ {Conceptual Analysis, Method of Cases, Reflective Equilibrium, Conceptual Engineering, Formal Logic, Naturalizations, Experimental Philosophy, ILP, OLP, Phenomenal Conservatism, ...}

Continental Philosophy $\approx$ {Hermeneutics, Dialectics, Material Conditions analysis, Phenomenology, Critical Theory, Deconstruction, ...}

(Neo-)Pragmatic Philosophy $\approx$ {Ironism, Quietism, Fideism, Analyzing Language Games, OLP, ...}

Scholastic Philosophy $\approx$ {Natural Theology, Negative Theology, Revelation, ...}


But the sets are vague, and nothing says debates about the sets are any good to have, as contrary to the methods themselves. While I do think Formal Logic as a method in philosophy is overwhelmingly powerful and good, where I see no reason to support Natural Language based philosophy instead. However for all other methodologies, I am unsure about it (though I suspect many of the pragmatic and continental one's as very bad in some regards). So while I will consider myself analytical for now, I do not think methodology debates on grand-scales such as between analytic, continental and pragmatic are any good.
