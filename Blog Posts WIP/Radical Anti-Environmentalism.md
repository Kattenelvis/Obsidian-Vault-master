Idea: Might be part of a larger series of posts



I am not against measures to prevent climate change, nor am I against sustainability in the short term. But from many ethical systems, and from self-interest, it is better than, if not obligatory, to eventually dismantle the environment once technology has progressed far enough. I will show that from all self-interest views (pleasure-hedonic, desire satisfaction and most objective list theories) aswell as self-interest aggregation under contractarian and deontological approaches, aswell as most reasonable utilitarian rules, all imply radical anti-environmentalism. 


Radical anti-environmentalism: The environment has no inherent value, and it is good to dismantle it into a preferable configuration.


This is in contrast with standard anti-environmentalism which only sees nature as having neutral value. I see it as having negative value. 

## Philosophical assumptions
I hereby lay our some premises for my argument which will be argued for at another time:

Mind Upload: Survival given Chalmers ship-of-Theseus solution where we slowly replace biological neurons with digital neurons and introspect if we're loosing consciousness or not.

Experience machine: We don't loose anything valuable by entering virtual worlds within experience machines. 

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Can be controlled and aligned, but potentially hard

The Technological Singularity: More likely than not to occur after AGI is invented

The idea is to eventually dismantle the solar system and using some of the resources to build a Dyson-sphere powered matryoshka brain, and some of it to travel to other stars.

## Argument from Self-Interest

Hedonic-Pleasure: By entering the experience machine for billions of years, we can experience immense pleasure.

Objection: Nature is pleasurable.

It is not as pleasurable as the experience machine.

Desire-Satisfaction: Experience machines satisfy all (or atleast almost all) your potential desires. 

Objective List: Knowledge and Friendships can be maximized within the experience machine. Habbo Hotel account of matryoshka brain ensures friendship valuing remains. 


## Argument from Contractarian approaches

As it is in our best self interest, it is also in our collective self-interest in agreement with other individuals. Digital minds can enter contractual relationships and establish norms that govern and prevent bad outcomes, such as radical mind-replication which could lead to runaway darwinian-malthusian pressures that we'd prefer to escape from rather than exacerbate. If such agreement is impossible, it undermines my entire argument and we should not build an matryioshka brain. However such a situation is not highly likely. 


## Argument from Utilitarian rules

Most of nature has a decent amount of suffering[source] but it has been argued that wild-animal suffering can be very high[source]. For instance, imagine an new born otter whose parents are murdered whose home is then flooded, the baby otter barely holding on and partially drowning over an extended period of time. Perhaps more wild-animal lives will have been of this kind than enjoyable one's. Starvation, etc.

Two main objections persist. The first is that there are other ways of resolving wild-animal suffering than dismantling and ensuring no new are born. The second is that most animal lives are more enjoyable in total. The third is that nature is beautiful and we experience it.



And for the third one I will just recite what's said above, an experience machine can give you vastly more beautiful experiences than nature. 

Another utilitarian approach is to recognize the amount of happy lives that can be created by even just a small piece of the earth. A conservative estimate on how much each von-neuman probe would need is x kg. As such, a decent chunk of say, the moon, could launc $x\cdot pM$ could travel to $pM$ number of planets and produce in turn some set of von-neumann probes, allowing the establishment of even more dyson sphere's faster. In the long run, this may create 10^99 happy lives.



# The case against terraforming and for matryoshka brains

Proposals have been put forth to terraform Mars and other planets[source]. I will argue against this view, instead proposing the dismantlement of the planets in favor of matryoshka brains.

Enter the experience machine

More efficient

More good maximisation


## Conclusion

The overall assessment of the environment is that it is not worth saving, and that there are many better uses to be put to it.
