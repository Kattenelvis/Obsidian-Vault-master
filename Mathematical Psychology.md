Axiomatic methodThe axiomatic approach to theory building proceedsby capturing theoretical assumptions about somedomain in terms of formal axioms. Then the theoryis developed by establishing theorems that state theconsequences implied by the joint acceptance ofthe axioms. The axioms should be as simple aspossible, and with some technical concessions tothe language of mathematics, each axiom should beempirically testable (falsifiable). A test of the theorythen consists of checking on the empirical adequacy ofthe behavioral predictions. There are many examplesof the successful use of this approach in mathematicalpsychology such as in the area of psychophysics,e.g., Ref 37, in the area of decision making,28andin applications of basic measurement theory, e.g.,Ref 38,39 fails to account for one of its predictions, it is oftenpossible to locate the problem in one of its axioms.However, the axioms of most theories in mathematicalpsychology are algebraic in character and as such theydiffer from stochastic models in that they do not havean underlying probabilistic theory of measurementerror. This lack of statistical underpinnings oftenmakes it difficult to decide if experimental datasuitably satisfy the consequences of the axioms. Therehave been efforts to provide statistically testableunderpinnings for theories couched in algebraicaxioms, e.g., Ref 40, and further successes of theaxiomatic approach may depend on more work ofthis kind.
