"Logic in philosophy of science"

"Hilary Putnam claimed that the Löwenheim-Skølem theorem reduces metaphysical realism to absurdity; Bas van Fraassen claimed that arguments against empiricism presuppose the syntactic view of theories; and W. v. O. Quine claimed that Carnap’s notion of an “external question” falls apart because every many-sorted theory is equivalent to a single-sorted theory"

"First, the distinction between realism and antirealism really boils down to one’s attitude toward theoretical equivalence. Realists are people with a conservative notion of equivalence, and antirealists are people with a liberal notion of equivalence."

"Among the logical positivists, the predominant view was a sort of antirealism, certainly about metaphysical claims, but also about the theoretical claims of science. Not surprisingly, the preferred view of theoretical equivalence among the logical positivists was empirical equivalence: two theories are equivalent just in case they make the same predictions. That notion of equivalence is quite liberal in that it equates theories that intuitively seem to be inequivalent. If we leap forward to the end of the twentieth century, then the outlook had changed radically. Here we find analytic metaphysicians engaged in debates about mereological nihilism versus universalism, or about presentism versus eternalism. We also find philosophers of physics engaged in debates about Bohmian mechanics versus Everettian interpretations of quantum mechanics, or about substantivalism versus relationalism about spacetime. The interesting point here is that there obviously had been a radical change in the regnant standard of theoretical equivalence in the philosophical community. Only seventy years prior, these debates would have been considered pseudodebates, for they attempt to choose between theories that are empirically equivalent. In short, the philosophical community as a whole had shifted from a more liberal to a more conservative standard of theoretical equivalence."
