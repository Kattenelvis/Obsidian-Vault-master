Three versions of empiricist foundationalism

Strong vs Weak foundationalism

Pure and impure (impure sounds a lot like fundherentism)

Coherentism: Egalitarian and inegalitarian depending on how it accepts every coherent set of beliefs as equally true or not.

"The uncompromising version disallows the possibilities both that any belief could have a distinguished initial status, independently of its relations to other beliefs, and that any belief could be more intimately interlocked in a set of beliefs than other members of the set."

There's a logical space between them!
Coherentism: $Jpq\leftrightarrow Jqp$
"Coherentism requires justification to be exclusively a matter of relations among beliefs"

Foundationalism negates those two above

"So: a theory which allows non-belief input cannot be coherentist; a theory which does not require one-directionality cannot be foundationalist."

This is BIG

Foundationalists assume that coherentism is vicious circularity

Impure foundationalism allows circularity

too much to ask objection: Coherentism entilas that one inconsistent belief makes no belief justified.

The drunken sailor argument about how two drunken sailors cannot back both of themselves up. Weird name. It's an argument against coherentism and self-justificatory foundationalism.


Evidentialist takedown of extrinsic foundationalism: 
People are justified in holding beliefs which has a certain causal connection that the subject have no evidence to support, and people are not justified in holding beliefs which lacks certain causal connection with the subject but which there is a lot of evidence for.

She then goes on to argue that weak experientialist foundationalism have problems that are resolved by transmuting the theory into foundherentism. The reason is that beliefs about for example conscious state or predisposition to hallucinations might affect beliefs regarding experience (such as "there is a dog there").  Same with impure foundationalism and weighted coherentism.


C.I Lewis claims to be an infallibilistic strong foundationalist, however he claims beliefs about memory could affect one's beliefs about non-current empirical beliefs.
