Revel et all Liquid Democracy in Practice: An Empirical Analysis of its Epistemic Performance:

Main result of the study: People do in fact delegate to people with more expertise than themselves (statistically significant).

"While [2, 7, 20] exposed negative results for liquid democracy exhibiting pathological graphs with an intolerable amount of con centration of power and proving hardness results when trying to f ind the optimal delegation flows, Halpern et al. identify delega tion behavior assuming connected social structure such that liquid democracy proves to be a better-performing voting system than direct democracy. 

Note that liquid democracy has further been studied through many lenses other than this epistemic one. From a political econ omy perspective, Green-Armytage [15] studies whether utility maximizing agents would rationally delegate; Bloembergen et al. [3] and Zhang and Grossi [42] analyze more sophisticated game theoretic frames to motivate both voters and delegates‚Äô rationale in liquid democracy. Christoff and Grossi [8] investigate logically interdependent propositions connecting liquid democracy to a De Groot model where voters ‚Äúcopy‚Äù their neighbor‚Äôs signal."


"Others have proposed various practical solutions to bypass em pirical hurdles associated with liquid democracy: Brill and Talmon [5] proposed to let voters nominate multiple delegates in case some abstain and also suggests ways to let a central planner decide who would receive the delegation among the short-list. In a similar vein, G√∂lz et al. [14] offers to let voters nominate ùëò delegates and rely on a central planner to choose the delegation graph that would minimize concentration of power"

"Finally, political philosophers have been studying the normative properties of liquid democracy [4, 39] and proposing it as an alter native to the current legislative processes [25, 40]. Such research often follows [23]‚Äôs minority view that representative democracy, if achieved through cogent elections, may be a greater form of democracy than direct democracy."
