That preface is POWERFUL

Reduction is transitive a reduces to b, b to c, then a to c.
Construction constructs the higher level from the lower level
Construction systems can be axiomatized


"On the other hand, the reduction of "reality" to the "given" has in recent times been considered an important task and has been partially accomplished, for example, by Avenarius, Mach, Poincaré, Külpe, and especially by Ziehen and Driesch (to mention only a few names)."

"The supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this: Wherever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred entities"

"If a constructional system of concepts or objects (it can be taken in either sense; cf. § 5) is possible in the manner indicated, then it follows that the objects do not come from several unrelated areas, but that there is only one domain of objects and therefore only one science. We can, of course, still differentiate various types of objects if they belong to different levels of the constructional system, or, in case they are on the same level, if their form of construction is different. Later on (III A), we shall show that the objects on higher levels are not constructed by mere summation, but that they are logical complexes. The object state,6 for example, will have to be constructed in this constructional system out of psychological processes, but it should by no means be thought of as a sum of psychological processes. We shall distinguish between a whole and a logical complex. The whole is composed of its elements; they are its parts. An independent logical complex does not have this relation to its elements, but rather, it is characterized by the fact that all statements about it can be transformed into statements about its elements."

"These two parallel languages which deal with concepts and with objects and still say the same thing are actually the languages of realism and idealism. Does thinking "create" the objects, as the Neo-Kantian Marburg school teaches, or does thinking "merely apprehend" them, as realism asserts? Construction theory employs a neutral language and maintains that objects are neither "created" nor "apprehended" but constructed. I wish to emphasize from the beginning that the phrase "to construct" is always meant in a completely neutral sense. From the point of view of construction theory, the controversy between "creation" and "apprehension" is an idle linguistic dispute."

"In the first chapter (A) of Part II, the very important concept of a structure (in the sense of the purely formal aspects of a relation extension) will be explained, and its fundamental importance for science will be shown. It will be demonstrated that it is in principle possible to characterize all objects through merely structural properties (i.e., certain formal-logical properties of relation extensions or complexes of relation extensions) and thus to transform all scientific statements into purely structural statements. In the second chapter (B), the most important types of objects, namely the physical, the psychological, and the cultural 12 will be briefly discussed as to their characteristics, differences, and mutual relations."


"In Part IV, some of the results of the preceding investigations are applied in practice; an outline of a constructional system is attempted. The lower levels of the system are given in great detail (Chapter A) by representing __________ 16 sachlich 17 Sachverhaftsangabe 14 | THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD the individual constructions in symbolic form and translating them into three auxiliary languages (cf. § 7). We give this part in such great detail, not because its content is absolutely secure, but in order to give a very clear example of the point of the whole investigation and, in addition, to do some spade work on the problem of achieving a reasonable formulation of the lower levels. Using only one basic relation, we shall construct in this part, among other things, the sense qualities, the sense modalities, the visual sense, the spatial order of the visual field, the qualitative order of the color solid, and a preliminary time order. In the second chapter (B), the constructions are given only in the word language, and no longer with the previous precision, but the individual steps are still clearly described. Here, the space-time world and the visual things in it, including "my body", as one of these visual things, the other senses (besides vision), and the other "autopsychological" entities, components, and states are constructed. The visual world is supplemented by the other senses until it becomes the sensory world, and this world is contrasted with the world of physics," which is no longer concerned with sensory qualities. In the third chapter (C), constructions are given in rough outline and only to the extent necessary to show that they can be carried out. In particular, we shall indicate the construction of the "heteropsychological" on the basis of "other persons" (as physical things) with the aid of the expression relation; the construction of the "world of the other person" and the "intersubjective world". Finally, the construction of cultural objects and values is also briefly indicated."

Scientific theories "want to" transform all of the intrinsic properties into relational properties. 

Property description of color for example, such as "red" and "blue" would be an incomplete scientific theory, however once the theory of light developed enough we could get rid of the internal properties of a color and instead asign a relational description by assigning relations between colors and wavelenghts.

Structure descriptions are a type of relational description where 
"In a structure description, only the structure of the relation is indicated, i.e., the totality of its \[properties\] ... that can be formulated without reference to the meaning 20 of the relation and the type of objects between which it holds".

Formal properties include:
Transitivity
Reflexivity
Connectedness
Symmetrical

Relational map: An arrow diagram can reprsent the structure of a relation between objects. Isomorphisms exists between same looking arrow diagrams. However science does not analyse this (scientific statements are not statements about relational structures with no care for the objects), they use definite descriptions of wordly objects.

> # What is the current status of Carnap's external-internal distinction in modern philosophy?


> This is a hard one, because no one is really addressing the set of questions in those terms these days. That said, there have been a host of projects over the last couple decades that have touched on the distinction or on related topics. Probably the most famous recent-ish paper in this area is

> Yalbo, Stephen. 1998. "Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?" _Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society_ 72: 229-61. [link](https://www.mit.edu/~yablo/om.pdf)

I can tell you that Yalbo's paper has been extremely influential, but I couldn't tell you whether that's because people accept it or because they don't.

In the same vein as Yablo, there's a whole bunch of recent work by by metaphysicians that is often called "neo-Carnapian." I sortof find this work to not engage with Carnap's actual views is any interesting way, but certainly there's something like the "internal-external" distinction that shows is Amie Thomasson's work. And her work is really good, so that's another place you might look.

By contrast to the above, you might consider:

> Friedman, Michael. 2001. _Dynamics of Reason._

Yablo tackles the distinction from a _very_ metaphysical viewpoint, with a particular focus on _ESO_. Friedman's more historical and more focused on issues in philosophy of science. The picture that he offers is one that combines the Carnap internal/external distinction with a Kuhnian or quasi-Kuhnian picture.

Speaking of historical. I haven't yet read

> Gary Ebbs. 2017. _Carnap, Quine, and Putnam on Methods of Inquiry_.

but one of the essays in that volume is on Carnap's ontological views and (knowing Ebbs' other work), I would expect it to be both excellent and a really good resource, though he's liable to focus more on the historical questions than on contemporary applications.

Finally, there's supposed to be a volume titled _Philosophical Methodology After Carnap_ in the works. I last heard about that in 2019 maybe? and can't find anything new on the subject, so I guess it's still forthcoming. I imagine that will have some essays that touch on the distinction, but who knows.
