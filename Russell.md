On denoting:


Meinongs theory that all descriptions refer to objects with described properties is contradictory, like "the existing golden mountain", meinong claims that "exist" and "of existence" is different, but Russell doesn't agree. 

Frege has a different view, where words can have a sense but not a reference. 

Frege does not believe in LEM. A sentence with a non-referential description has no meaning and can thus not be true nor false. This is for two reasons: 
1. compsitionality, a sentence sense and reference are built up by the sense and reference of the words in the sentence. 
2. If p is false then not p is true. If a non-refering sentence is false then it's negation must be true instead, which is weird.
