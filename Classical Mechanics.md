1. So anyways with Lagrangian mechanics and a system in N dimensions you end up having to solve N second order differential equations
    
2. _[_00:39_]_
    
    Meanwhile with Hamiltionan mechanics in N dimension you have a system of 2N (possibly coupled) linear differential equations

Susskind: Classical is based on the principle of least action


Initial conditions: $q_1,\dots q_n$ 
With velocities $\dot{q}_1, \dots \dot{q}_n$

The lagrangian based on the q's and q dots

$\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q_i,\dot{q_i})dt$

$L = T - U(q)$


Idea: This is probably not true in reality, despite its application in all major fields of fundamental physics. I believe this is the case because the lagrangian would be solving NP hard problems in constant time.

Non-teleological, because Newtons laws/differential equations are more local and determine the evolution of a set of coordinates
