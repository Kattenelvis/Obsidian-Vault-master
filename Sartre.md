In-Itself:
$\exists (a_1),\dots\exists(a_n)$

For-Itself: let $c_1=$consciousness of agent 1
$R(c_1, a_1)$

"c1 is being conscious of object a" where object a has transcendental (beyond experience) existence.

Maybe

$R(c_k, a_m)$


There's some argument I don't quite understand that seems to claim that for-itself is transcendental aswell, not just objects. 

$\neg R(c_k,c_k)$
?
