Structural realism posits that while scientific entities, sometimes including observables and not just unobservables, don't exist, structures do.

<idea>
Structure: A set of objects with relation to eachother R(x,y)

Like an neutron or proton with a gluon color-exchange relation between quarks as a part of the strong nuclear force 
G(up, down, down)

The "Fido"-Fido assumption may be broken since "up" doesn't designate any actually existing up quark in the langueage of structural realism. It is in turn a structure. 

But this leads to an infinite regress of structures.

Just like how there can be structural correspondence between theories over time, there can be structural correspondence (or even isomorphisms) between two theories by two different researchers analysing the same experiment and improving it, even if the auxiliarry hypotheisises are different.


OMG Aufbau by Carnap writes about this!
Science analyses the structure between objects in a domain and their relations. The example of train stations and the graph-theoretic map over their connection is a great example to demonstrate it. Only on some very strange graphs, where there exists homotopic points, does this not work. One can then, using the structural properties only for a definite description of every object in the domain/graph. Without using any objects from outside the domain. The goal is then to make science analyse one big domain of obejcts and their structural properties, since otherwise one can with ostensive definitions become highly subjective. One can also not take in the domain from anywhere else since science researchers the entire domain by definition. 

"One can easily see that physics is almost altogether desubjectivized, since almost all physical concepts have been transformed into purely structural concepts. To begin with, all mathematical concepts are reducible to concepts which stem from the theory of relations: four-dimensional tensor and vector fields are structural schemata; the network of world lines with the relations of coincidence and local time order is a structural schema in which only two relations are still named; and even these are uniquely determined through the character of the schema."

"From the point of view of construction theory, this state of affairs is to be described in the following way. The series of experiences is different for each subject. If we want to achieve, in spite of this, agreement in the names for the entities which are constructed on the basis of these experiences, then this cannot be done by reference to the completely divergent content, but only through the formal description of the structure of these entities. However, it is still a problem how, through the application of uniform formal construction rules, entities result which have a structure which is the same for all subjects, even though they are based on such immensely different series of experiences. This is the problem of inter-subjective reality."
