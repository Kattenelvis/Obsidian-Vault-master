Idea: Psychological law: 
$(Desire(p)\wedge K(a\rightarrow p)\wedge \diamondsuit a) \rightarrow p$


The buddhist theorem: For any desired state $p$, by getting rid of desires, by taking the actual state $p$ and making that one's desire, allows one to maximise happiness. Basically, matching one's goals with the current world state.
