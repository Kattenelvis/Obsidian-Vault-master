The definition of the turnstyle  is then completed by saying that  is the smallest relation (between sets of sentences and sentences) such that 1.  is closed under the previously given clauses, and 2. If   φ and  ⊆  , then   φ. 
The second property here is called **monotonicity**.

definition 1.3.4 (Tarski truth) Given an interpretation v of  and a sentence φ of , we say that φ is true in v just in case v(φ) = 1. definition 1.3.5 For a set  of  sentences, we say that v is a model of  just in case v(φ) = 1, for all φ in . We say that  is consistent if  has at least one model, and that  is inconsistent if it has no models.

proof of relative consistency.
