Standard semantics contains the three following:
- Theory of Reference/Designation
- Theory of Meaning
- Theory of Truth


"Fido"-Fido assumption: A term is meaningful if it has a referent. En expression is meaningful if every object in it has a referent. 

Only meaningful statements have truth values

Satisfaction
"x is white"\<snow\> , i.e "snow satisfies x is white"

Designation
"The president of the United States" designates "Joe Biden". Russells theory of description and unique designation and Frege replacability of designators.

Definition
definians and definiandum,

Consequence

Synonymity

Meaning





The promise of a purely syntactic metatheory for mathematics fell into question already in the 1930s when Kurt Gödel proved the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic. At the time, a new generation of logicians realized that not all interesting questions about theories could be answered merely by looking at theories “in themselves”, and without relation to other mathematical objects. Instead, they claimed, the interesting questions about theories include questions about how they might relate to antecedently understood mathematical objects, such as the universe of sets. Thus was born the discipline of logical semantics. The arrival of this new approach to metatheory was heralded by Alfred Tarski’s famous definitions of “truth in a structure” and “model of a theory.” Thus, after Tarski, to understand a theory T , we have more than the theory qua syntactic object, we also have a veritable universe Mod(T ) of models of T .

It is convenient to introduce the expression 'primitively denotes' as follows: every name primitively denotes what it denotes; every predicate and every function symbol primitively denotes what it applies to or is fulfilled by; and no complex expression primitively denotes anything


'Undefined' has no referent.
Sentences with 'undefined' as proper noun have no truth value since it is meaningless. 
Meta-language can talk about 'undefined'

Distributional semantics uses probabilistic models for meaning. The meaning of a word changes for every instance that it is surrounded by different words that update the probabilistic model. Apparently meaning should be static? I have objections.

"The principal function of natural language is to exchange information; so the first section focuses on a general, formal and unified representation of information. This task is not as difficult as it appears. We start from a scientific analysis of the procedure through which a piece of information is obtained, then seek out the necessary components to fix a minimal piece of information, and finally represent each minimal piece of information by a sequence of parameter values called a primitive observation. Primitive observations are the fundamental meaning elements of the new semantic theory, and the main part of the first section is to clarify those components and parameters from which primitive observations are formed. The second section constructs a kind of mathematical model called cognitive model, under which natural language expressions could be recursively interpreted. Like other semantic models, worlds, objects and events are the most important components of a cognitive model; unlike Formal Semantics, a cognitive model provides a world, an object or an event with descriptive contents, using primitive observations."




Primitive concepts (Chalmers)
[primitive.pdf (consc.net)](https://consc.net/slides/primitive.pdf)

Terms can be defined by other terms, like bachelor = unmarried man and knowledge = true justified belief. Primitive terms cannot be defined from more primitive terms. A primitive is a term that cannot be defined using terms other than rewordings of itself.

Empiricists: n Primitive concepts are simple phenomenal and/or perceptual concepts 

Carnap (in the Aufbau) A single primitive concept: recollected phenomenal similarity

Roger Schank: Conceptual Dependency theory n 11 primitive action concepts: ATRANS, PTRANS, MOVE, PROPEL, GRASP, INGEST, EXPEL, ATTEND, SPEAK, MBUILD, DO  

Anna Wierzbicka: Semantic primes n 60+ primitive lexical items
