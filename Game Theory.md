Assume no revolution brings zero utility ($U(\neg r) = 0$)

Assume two player payout has the same structure but with differnet utility function i.e each payout has a simple notation $U(p) = U_{gov}(p),U_{pop}(p)$

|                          | No Revolution | Revolution         |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **Implement Policy**     | $U(p)$        | $U(p)-U(r)$        |
| **Not Implement Policy** | $U(\neg p)$   | $U(\neg p) - U(r)$ |

Postulate: Revolution is worth it iff $U_{rev}(p)-U_{rev}(r) > U_{rev}(\neg p) - U_{rev}(r)$

"Hintikka (1973a) initiated the application of GTS to the study of natural language. This work was continued notably by Hintikka & Kulas (1983, 1985), where game-theoretical rules for such items as negation, anaphoric pronouns, genitives, tenses, intensional verbs, certain prepositional constructions, and proper names were given, and the distinction between abstract meaning and strategic meaning drawn.[[14](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-if/notes.html#note-14)]"
