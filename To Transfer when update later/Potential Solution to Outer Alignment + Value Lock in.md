- Assume ASI exists and inner alignment is solved
- Each post-human is in their own virtual world
- Each post-human is entitled to their own preferences and values, that do not interfere with other virtual worlds
- The ASI that takes decisions to plan out everything is controlled by direct democracy by each post-human, who are likely superintelligent enough and obviously have time to vote on many topics
- People's values may change, so we vote for a different ASI decisions
- People are allowed to maximise their own preferences inside virtual worlds. 

Compare this to anarchic structure where each post-human makes agreements with other post-humans. 

Compare this to a dicatorial rule by ASI maximising some objective value
