How would your virtual world be like? Let's say we succeed. We're not taken out by ambivalent ASI, or global warming, or some other existential risk. A Dyson sphere has been built, and our consciousness is either computationally uploaded or in some way continued into such a configuration (brain in vats with inputs). You would now live in perfectly realistic, vivid and fully craftable virtual worlds. You can craft your consciousness to your wildest desires. What do you do?

Here's mine: 

Main Aesthethic: Petalcore, Cottagecore, Solarpunk
Secondary Aesthethic: Space, geometric patterns, physics-themed

Aesthethic shifts should be possible (just like we might not want value lock-in, this includes aesthethic value lock-in). I'm not sure what unthinkably beautiful landascapes may be made in such a future, but I'm all for it.

I'd be atleast partially superintelligent. I'd try to figure out the mysteries of the universe, and a unified theory of quantum-gravity-consciousness theory of everything. I'd read through all books humanity ever wrote, including all of philosophy (yes, including continental philosophy) and all literature, all art ever made. I don't really enjoy literature right now, but I probably will if I feel high all the time and I have billions, or even heptillions of years on me. I'd prove mathematical theorems all day. I'd learn everything about cosmology and geology and geography and I'd run ancestor simulations to understand sociology and history. I'd try to figure out how to reverse entropy to ensure that the simulation can run forever (this might be impossible).

My phenomenology would likely involve a high degree of pleasure sensation at all times, with a changeable dial. I used to believe that high pleasure was all sensation needed, but I've since realized what a waste of potential that is. A friend of mine still seems ardent to do this, but I will not join him. I think that a good degree of it, in my virtual world, will be needed. I will basically be high on heroin at all times, without any of the negatives of the drug. Pure pleasure. High on other drugs too, like DMT would be a common experience for me. Unthinkable dream landscapes would be crafted.   

If I'd even need an avatar, I'd be Niko Oneshot. I'd love to eventually change it, but I'm not sure what would be better. 

I'm for keeping around information about earth. This way I can explore it, likely in a liminal way without any other humans, with the exception of some NPCs. 

When it comes to realizing sexual fetishes, it might be considered odd or rule-breaking to mention them. So I won't for the moment. But I would realize rather weird and out-there fantasies, involving stuff that is currently impossible to achieve with current technology. I do not have typical interests

I am aromantic, and I currently have no plans on including the perfect partner in my simulated world. I would hope for multiplayer connectivity and inviting people to one's virtual world, where I can know other consciousnesses are. They can leave whenever they want. There may be filters in case some worlds are repulsive to some agents. I hope most of the people I currently know will make it to have their own virtual world. 

The music that would play: Alexander Panos hell yeah

Liberal Transhumanism can easily accommodate the view that everyone has their own virtual world, where they will not be interfered by others, and they will not interfere with others. You may believe everyone should purely experience pure please, or some kind of suffering. Here's a strong letter from me: Fuck off from my world. I don't want purely pleasure, I don't want any suffering. Fuck off, and I will fuck off from forcing your world to be like mine.
