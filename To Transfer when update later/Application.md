My current plan for improving the world is to improve governance structures with digital democracy, liquid democracy and prediction markets to support better decision making within organizations to be more rational, including organizations such as EA. The key steps taken is being the main developer for the last 2 years for our application "flowback" which is now entering early testing stages.

My most significant engagement with EA has been holding a presentation on flowback in two talks (one at EA, one for AI safety Sweden). I'm also engaged as a main organizer in the local AI safety group, which has close ties to the EA group. I've also taken an AI governance course at a local group. 

I hope to get good connections in Utrecht. Specifically looking for people into digital democracy, direct democracy, AI governance and AI safety aswell as anyone responsible for decision making in any EA adjacent organization where flowback may be applied.
