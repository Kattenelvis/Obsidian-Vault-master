Smells like....category theory??? More like differential equations but I wanna sound cool


Are some of these theories merely a priori, or are all making predictions that can be tested? I'm thinking especially for voting theory, social choice theory, social procedures.


What are the fundamental axioms of these theories? Can they be formalized logically, can we proove contradictions between them? Can neoclassical economics and marxist economics be formalised and shown to derive a contradiction? Is that important? Is there a functor between the category of marxism and the category of neoclassical?


Preferences assumtions on completeness and transitivieness. 
VNM-axioms add two more: irrelevance of third options and a fourth one

# Frequentist vs Bayesian Statistics

Important assumptions on the non-a priori fields: Induction, Probability and Statistics. Usual assumptions in most fields seem to assume that there is no sceptical solution to the problem of indcution, frequentist probability and statistics. T-tests, Chai squared and p-values are important. 

Most social science assumes Frequentist statistics.

[Philosophy of Statistics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/Entries/statistics/#ClaStaResCri)
"It should be emphasized that Bayesian statistics is not the sole user of an epistemic notion of probability. Indeed, a frequentists understanding of probabilities assigned to statistical hypotheses seems nonsensical. But it is perfectly possible to read the probabilities of events, or elements in sample space, as epistemic, quite independently of the statistical method that is being used. As further explained in the next section, several philosophical developments of **classical statistics employ epistemic probability, most notably fiducial probability (Fisher 1955 and 1956; see also Seidenfeld 1992 and Zabell 1992), likelihoodism (Hacking 1965, Edwards 1972, Royall 1997), and evidential probability (Kyburg 1961**), or connect the procedures of classical statistics to inference and support in some other way. In all these developments, probabilities and functions over sample space are read epistemically, i.e., as expressions of the strength of evidence, the degree of support, or similar."

Minor perspectives:
Fidual Calculus, a kind of classical statistics with an epistemic view of probability 

# Methodological Indivudalism vs Holism
Methodological holism: Explanans and Explanandum are macro-social variables. For example: We can explain increased loan taking with that there has been a decrease in interest rates. 

Methodological individualism: If the Explanans is a macro-social variable, then the Explanandum has to be a micro-social variable or psychological variable. For example: We can explain increased loan taking with that individual preferences/EU calculations for loans has increased. This may in turn be explained by decreased interest rate, which can in turn be explained by what individuals are doing (say the self-interest of central banks). 


# Syntactic Vs Semantic structure of scientific theories

Positivistic social science emphasise the idea of formal axioms (the syntactic view on the structure of scientific theories), while in the post-positivistic era, science emphasise the semantic view of scientific theories of models


"Writ large, social sciences appear to seek improved scientific legitimacy by copying the century-old linear deterministic modeling of classical physics—with economics in the lead ([2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b2))—at the same time natural sciences strongly rooted in linear determinism are trending toward nonlinear computational formalisms ([1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b1), [3](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b3)). The postmodernist perspective takes note of the **heterogeneous-agent ontology of social phenomena**, calling for abandoning classical normal science epistemology and its **assumptions of homogeneous agent behavior, linear determinism, and equilibrium**."


"Social scientists need to thank postmodernists for their constant reminder about the reality of heterogeneous social agent behavior, but they need to stop listening to postmodernists at this point and instead study the epistemology of “new” normal science."

HAhahaha couldn't agree more


"Finally, social scientists need to take note of the other nonpostmodernist postpositivisms that give legitimacy: _scientific realism_, _evolutionary epistemology_, and the model-centered science of the _Semantic Conception_"

Is a return to positivism possible? I have argued this before in my blogpost on it


"Third, Campbell ([16](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b16)) combines scientific realism with semantic relativism. Nola ([9](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b9)) separates relativism into three kinds:

1. Ontologically nihilistic. “Ontological relativism is the view that what exists, whether it be ordinary objects, facts, the entities postulated in science, etc., exists only relative to some relativizer, whether that be a person, a theory or whatever” ([9](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b9)).

2. Epistemologically nihilistic. Epistemological relativisms may allege that what is known or believed is relativized to individuals, cultures, or frameworks; what is perceived is relative to some incommensurable paradigm; and that there is no general theory of scientific method, form of inquiry, rules of reasoning or evidence that has privileged status. Instead they are variable with respect to times, persons, cultures, and frameworks.

3. Semantically weak. Semantic relativism holds that truth and falsity are “… relativizable to a host of items from individuals to cultures and frameworks. What is relativized is variously sentences, statements, judgments or beliefs” ([9](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.092079799#core-b9))."


"
1. A scientific realist postpositivist epistemology that maintains the goal of objectivity in science without excluding metaphysical terms.

2. A selectionist evolutionary epistemology governing the winnowing out of less probable theories, terms, and beliefs in the search for increased verisimilitude may do so without the danger of systematically replacing metaphysical terms with operational terms.

3. A postrelativist epistemology that incorporates the dynamics of science without abandoning the goal of objectivity.

4. An objectivist selectionist evolutionary epistemology that includes as part of its path toward increased verisimilitude the inclusion of, but also the winnowing out of the more fallible, individual interpretations and social constructions of the meanings of theory terms comprising theories purporting to explain an objective external reality."


The syntactic view:

"The advantage of this view is that there seems to be a common platform to science and a rigor of analytical results. This conception eventually died for three reasons: 

1.  axiomatic formalization and correspondence rules proved untenable and were abandoned;
2. newer 20th century sciences did not appear to have any common axiomatic roots and were not easily amenable to the closed-system approach of Newtonian mechanics.
3. parallel to the demise of the Received View, the Semantic Conception of theories developed as an alternative approach for attaching meaning to syntax."


Surely 2 is false? I have seen books that axiomatize modern physics at the minimum. 




# A new way of doing social science

So it seems a common view in most of the fields laid at the start is:
1. Frequentist Statistics
2. Methodological Holism(?)
3. Semantic Structure 

Can I do it with the complete opposite?
1. Bayesian Statistics
2. Methodological Individualism
3. Syntactic structure



There are also assumptions of rationality (NVM), not sure what to do with those. Assumptions on how to divide different sectors of the economy. Ecological economics adds the assumption of the environment as an extra sector. Thermonomics talk about more than money flow in the economy, also includes matter and energy. 

Sectors:
Banks
Homes
Workplaces
Government
Environment (Earth)
The Sun

Sadly this article does not account for extensive form games, which I think is the heart of marxist analysis of class/power. Try to find papers which include that.
