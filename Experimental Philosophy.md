Personality difference impact philosophical viewpoints. More extraversion means larger degree of belief of free will and moral agency. Difference seem to have remained even among educated professional philosophers. Unclear difference between rationalism vs empiricism.

From Glacking:
"Chinese individuals seem to have predominantly “descriptivist” intuitions about the reference of proper names, whereas Americans’ are mostly “causal-historical” (Machery et al., 2004; Machery 2017, p.48; van Dongen et al. 2021; see Kripke 1980, p.83 − 4); around twice as many men as women report that they would willingly enter a Nozickian “experience machine” (Olivola et al., forthcoming; Machery 2017, p. 63; see Nozick 1974); the perceived moral acceptability of utilitarian approaches to “switching” trolley-cases is improved by presenting them after “footbridge” cases, whereas “footbridge” cases are not similarly affected by presentation order (Lanteri et al. 2008; Lombrozo 2009; Wiegmann et al. 2012; Machery 2017, p. 73; see Foot 1978). So it certainly looks as though philosophers should be cautious – more cautious than we have been, perhaps – in extrapolating from our own intuitive judgements to more general conclusions."
