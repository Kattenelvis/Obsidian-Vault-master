Superintelligences take over the universe in the future. The universe shrinks rather than accelerates, gravity or something pulls the universe back together at some point. All superintelligences, in war or cooperation with eachother, form one massive intelligence that has complete omniscience and omnipotence. Given it's final goals, it will maximise the probability that its final goals will be achieved in the universe post-singularity and rebounce. A type of deism, basically. 

To be able to predict the best way to furthering its final goals to next bump of the universe, it simulates universes. Different final configurations of matter and energy right before the big bounce (which is what the superintelligence is able to control) are simulated to see which one will maximise its chanses of achievieng its final goals in the next universe.
