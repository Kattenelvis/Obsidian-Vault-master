A)
Let $T$ be an update function and $E_i$ the experience at some point $i$.  
$T(E_i) = E_{i+1}$

B)
uhhhhhh

C)
$T(\{E_i,\dots E_{i+k}\})=\{E_{i+1},\dots E_{i+k+1}\}$


"In his influential writings on these matters William James argued that to make sense of our temporal experience we need to distinguish the _strict_ or mathematical present from the _experiential_ or _specious_ present: whereas the first is indeed durationless, the second is experienced as possessing a brief duration, sufficient to accommodate the change and persistence we find in our immediate experience. Proponents of the cinematic model maintain that James was mistaken: to make sense of our temporal experience we don’t need anything resembling an extended specious present. Proponents of the extensional and retentional views maintain that we _do_ need something resembling a specious present, but offer very different accounts of it.[[1](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/notes.html#note-1)]"

**Phenomeno-temporal Realism** (_PT-realism_, henceforth further abbreviated to _realism_): change, succession and persistence _can_ be directly perceived or apprehended.

**Phenomeno-temporal Antirealism** (_PT-antirealism_, henceforth further abbreviated to _antirealism_): change, succession and persistence _cannot_ be directly perceived or apprehended.

"The extensional and retentional models are currently the two most influential forms of realism, with both approaches being developed in a variety of different ways. The task facing antirealists is in one respect the easier of the two: unlike their realist counterparts, they are under no obligation to provide an intelligible account of how it is possible for our consciousness to embrace seemingly temporally extended phenomena. But in another respect their task is the more difficult. Antirealists are under an obligation to “save the (temporal) phenomena”: they need to supply a credible explanation as to why so many of us find it so natural to _say_ we perceive movement and change if in fact we don’t. After all, it _does_ seem perfectly natural to hold that we can see clouds move across the sky, feel water flowing through our fingers and hear melodies. This is the task facing those cinematic theorists—e.g., Chuard (2017)—who hold that we do not directly perceive change or succession but who also accept that we seem to."



[Temporal Consciousness > Some Relevant Empirical Findings (Psychology, Psychophysics, Neuroscience) (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Fall 2017 Edition)](https://plato.stanford.edu/archivES/FALL2017/Entries/consciousness-temporal/empirical-findings.html)

> In §5.2 we encountered the ‘discrete block’ conception: according to some philosophers (e.g., Bradley, Sprigge, Whitehead) our streams of consciousness are composed of non-overlapping sequences of Jamesian duration-blocks. To put it another way, our experience is _chunked_ or _quantized_. This model has its merits – it offers a phenomenologically plausible account of individual specious presents – it is also problematic: if awareness of phenomenal continuity is confined to the interiors of non-overlapping duration-blocks, it is hard to see how our experience could be as continuous as it is often thought to be.
