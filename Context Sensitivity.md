IDR: If reporters can easily and truly indirectly disquotationally report an utterance of a sentence S by an agent A, i.e., with ‘A said that S,’ despite indifference about, or ignorance of, its original context of utterance, then it is unlikely S is context-sensitive.

"Collectivity: Let u and u’ be utterances of S by A and B. If reporters can easily collect u and u’ into a single true indirect disquotational report, i.e., with ‘A and B both said that S,’ despite indifference about, or ignorance of, the original contexts of utterance, it is unlikely S is context—sensitive."


"Agree-1: If A utters S, B utters its negation, and they are not easily reported as disagreeing, say, with ‘A and B disagree whether S’, then S is semantically context-sensitive (Cappelen and Hawthorne 2009)"
"If A says “I’m happy” and B “I’m not happy,” no one would report them with “A and B disagree”; this is because “I” is context-sensitive."


"We can associate with the demonstrative type word “this” a function, which takes a context as argument and yields the object indicated, or otherwise rendered most salient, in the context. Each token of “this” then refers to the value of the function evaluated at the relevant context."


"ow for some terminology: the content of a token expression is its semantic interpretation in its particular context; the character of a type expression is a function which maps each context to the appropriate content. Notice that even non-context-sensitive expressions can be said to have characters—in such cases the character is a constant function. Notice also that whole sentences have characters. The character of the sentence “I was hungry yesterday,” for example, is a function which maps each context c to the proposition that the speaker at c was hungry on the day before the time of c. The terms “content” and “character” come from David Kaplan, who introduced this way of dealing with context-sensitivity (Kaplan 1989a, 1989b)"
