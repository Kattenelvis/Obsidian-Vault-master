1. Fundamentalness: Haskell is a statically typed functional programming language known for its strong type system and emphasis on mathematical foundations. It enforces strict immutability and encourages writing pure, side-effect-free functions. Python, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed, general-purpose language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. In terms of fundamentalness, Haskell's design aligns closely with mathematical and logical principles, which some developers find appealing for its clarity and correctness guarantees.

2. Data Analysis and Presentation: Python has gained significant popularity in the field of data analysis and scientific computing. It offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which provide powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Python's ease of use and extensive community support make it a preferred choice for data scientists and analysts. While Haskell has libraries available for data analysis, the ecosystem is not as mature or extensive as Python's, which may impact the ease and speed of development in this domain.

3. Creation of Machine Learning Algorithms: Python has emerged as a dominant language for machine learning due to its extensive libraries, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. These libraries provide efficient implementations of various machine learning algorithms and offer comprehensive toolkits for building and training models. Python's simplicity and readability make it accessible for developers new to machine learning. While Haskell has libraries like HLearn and TensorFlow Haskell bindings, the machine learning ecosystem in Haskell is still evolving and may not offer the same breadth and depth as Python.
