An entity ontologically depends on another entity if the first entity cannot exist without the second entity. Ontologically independent entities, on the other hand, **can exist all by themselves**. For example, the surface of an apple cannot exist without the apple and so depends on it ontologically.

1.  _Mereological disjointness._ This notion comes from mereology, the theory of parts and whole. Mereological disjointness is simply the relation, '... shares no common part with ...'. So e.g. Russia and Europe overlap, i.e. they have a common part (viz. the part of Russia west of the Ural mountains), so they are not disjoint; whereas Russia and Brazil are disjoint, since nothing is both a part of Russia and a part of Brazil. Disjointness doesn't really signify "reality" in any interesting sense; although of course objects must exist before it can be said that they overlap or are disjoint.
    
2.  _Failure of supervenience._ Supervenience is normally defined as a modal relation between sets of properties. The set A supervenes on the set B iff, in surveying all possibilities, any change in (any property in) A is accompanied by some change in (some property in) B. So e.g. chemical properties (arguably) supervene on physical properties, since any change in chemical properties (e.g. the group on the periodic table to which a particular atom belongs) is accompanied by some change in the physical properties (e.g. the number of the atom's bound electrons). This definition of supervenience can be straightforwardly extended from properties to propositions (construed as 0-ary properties), which allows us to talk about e.g. the chemical "facts" supervening on the physical "facts". If supervenience fails between two sets of properties/propositions A and B, then there is a definite sense in which A _can't_ just be a redescription of B, so A corresponds to at least some stuff which is autonomous from whatever B corresponds to. That is of course _not_ to say that if A _does_ supervene on B, then A _is_ just a redescription of B (although some have proposed that); but failure of supervenience serves as a reliable sufficient condition for some sort of autonomous stuff.
    
3.  _Failure of some other notion of grounding or ontological dependence._ Supervenience provides a very crisp notion in which you might want to say that A-facts are "grounded in" B-facts, or A-things are "ontologically dependent on" B-things; but [arguably there are others.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dependence-ontological/) If there are, then each kind will admit its own notion of ontological independence, which is just when the relation fails to hold.

Moreover, there are those who do not wish to commit to the ontologically heavyweight notion of essence, but who nevertheless employ the notion of ontological dependence (e.g., trope bundle theorists, such as Keinänen, Keskinen, & Hakkarainen 2019).

Let $E$ be existence predicate, then:
Existence depends rigidly: 
$\square(Ex\rightarrow Ey)$ 

Existence depends nominally:
	$\square(E(x)\rightarrow $

Exists depends genericaly:
$\square(Gx\rightarrow \exists Fy)$
