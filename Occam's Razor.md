"Sober's first publication on parsimony was his 1975 book, _Simplicity_. In it, he argued that the simplicity of a hypothesis should be understood in terms of a concept of question-relative informativeness. Sober abandoned this theory in the 1980s when he started to think about the concept of [cladistic parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistic_parsimony "Cladistic parsimony") used in evolutionary biology. This led him to think of parsimony in terms of the concept of likelihood, an idea he developed in his 1988 book _Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference_. In the 1990s he started to think about the role of parsimony in model selection theory—for example, in the [Akaike Information Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion "Akaike information criterion"). He published a series of articles in this area with Malcolm Forster, the first of which was their 1994 paper "How to Tell When Simpler, More Unified, or Less Ad Hoc Theories Will Provide More Accurate Predictions." In 2002 he published a new article "Instrumentalism, Parsimony, and the Akaike Framework," explaining how Akaike’s criterion and framework and the ideas behind them connect to the epistemology of instrumentalism. His most recent publication on parsimony, his 2015 book _Ockham's Razors: A User's Manual_, describes both the likelihood framework and the model selection frameworks as two viable "parsimony paradigms.""

My own arguments:

Because sense experience is given, either Idealism or Dualism is the case. Dualism is less parsemonious than Idealism (and has other problems), therefore Idealism is more likely to be the case.

Because natural laws seems to exist with or without a rational planning agent, then it's either the case that only natural laws exist or natural laws and superhuman rational actors exist, therefore it's more parsemonoius to believe in natural laws. 




Parsimonity as a methodology:

An ontology is a set of objects an relations that exist. It's the exhaustive list/set of everything that exists.

$O=\{x:E(x)\}$ 

Where $E$ is the existence predicate. 

Substance ontologies:

Definition: A substance is that which everything is made up off. Here's a typical list of substance ontologies:

Materialism
Idealism
Dualism
Neutral Monism
Free-action actor models 
Ternary model (mind, matter, soul)
Solipsism
e.t.c

Idea: Prove there exists an exhaustive list, construct such a list and demonstrate that it is exhaustive if possible. Otherwise prove it's impossible. 

Temporal ontologies:
Growing Block
Shrinking Block
Timeline fission
Timeline fusion
Presentism
Eternalism/Block theory
Emergentism
Thermodynamics

Ontology construction:
$O(S, T)$ with substance ontology $S$ and temporal ontology $T$ generates a set $O(S,T)$ called an "complete ontology"

Definition of parsimonity:

An complete ontology $O(S_i,T_x)$ is more parsimonious than another complete ontology $O(S_j,T_y)$ if $ $|O(S_i,T_x)| < |O(S_j,T_y)|$. 

The smallest complete ontology is thus the complete ontology that is more parsimonious than all other complete ontologies.
