"As mentioned earlier, once the MoC does get off the ground, it can be applied indefinitely: we don’t just stop when a counterexample undermines a theory, but instead revise the theory to avoid the counterexample and then test again (and so forth). The idea is that by repeatedly revising our theories to deal with the counterexamples that they encounter, our theories will slowly but surely improve, with the endpoint of this process ideally being a theory that gives (intuitively) correct verdicts no matter what cases we throw at it. Call this idea – that our theories will, through repeated testing and revision via the MoC, ultimately converge on a theory that is fully intuitively adequate (or at least very close to it)18 – the Convergence Assumption. 19"

"19 An especially vivid and self-contained example of the Convergence Assumption at work can be found in Parfit’s (2011) On What Matters (Vol. 1), in which numerous thought experimental cases are used to refine versions of consequentialism, deontology, and contractarianism until they (at least by Parfit’s contention) converge onto a unified set of necessary and sufficient criteria for morally right action (the BTriple Theory^). Another clear example of the Convergence Assumption as an organizing principle of philosophical inquiry is the post-Gettier efforts of epistemologists to come up with an analysis of knowledge that is immune to counterexamples, which has involved countless cycles of theory, counterexample, and revision. As a final example – this time within a particular theoretical tradition – consider the ever-growing menagerie of consequentialist theories of moral rightness, whose emergence has been driven largely by the susceptibility of previous formulations of consequentialism to counterexamples"

"The failure of the MoC to lead to clear progress and settled questions can be traced, in significant part, to the fact that no theory ever clears the bar of intuitive adequacy that the MoC sets out. No matter how plausible a proposed theory may seem, or how many times it has been revised to deal with previous counterexamples, philosophers are always able to come up with further counterexamples in which the theory’s verdicts clash with our intuitions. This leads to further rounds of revision to which more counterexamples are then devised, and so forth ad infinitum. (Call this the Problem of Counterexamples.) The result is stalemates in numerous areas of philosophy between theories that are, at least by the MoC’s standard of intuitive adequacy, flawed."

**Convergence Assumption** is defeated by **The problem of Counter-Examples**.


It's useless even for folk psychology, as Roch's work on Familiar Resemblence works against this view:

"This mismatch provides a compelling explanation for the Problem of Counterexamples – the inevitability with which theories encounter cases where their verdicts fail to match up with our intuitions and are therefore deemed inadequate by the lights of the MoC. The cause of the Problem of Counterexamples is not that philosophers theorizing about a given phenomenon simply have not been clever enough to come up with a set of necessary and sufficient criteria that avoids counterexamples. Rather, the cause is structural: for any theory that proposes necessary and sufficient criteria for some phenomenon of interest, there will always be cases in which it gives intuitively incorrect verdicts, since the concepts underlying our case-specific intuitions about what is or is not an instance of the phenomenon do not have classical structure."

"This can be seen most clearly by considering the notion of family resemblance briefly mentioned above. Family resemblance, recall, is the idea – originally posited by Wittgenstein (1953/2009) and later supported by the empirical research of Rosch and colleagues (e.g., Rosch 1975; Rosch and Mervis 1975; Mervis and Rosch 1981) –"


Idea: Sufficiently fine-grained conceptual analysis could in principle capture the familial resemblence, though it's have to be (1) a vague concept and (2) it would likely be very complicated, and by algoritithmic information theory not a good compression of the familial resemblence.

"For instance, if a hypothetical philosophy of furniture employed the MoC in the service of devising theories of furniture phenomena/concepts such as chair and table, its practitioners would find themselves in exactly the kinds of theoretical stalemates – the same endless cycles of theory, counterexample, and revision – that we see for actual philosophical phenomena/concepts such as knowledge and moral rightness. It may just be that, because actual philosophical inquiry tends be directed at difficult, complex targets, it becomes more difficult to notice – or at least easier to ignore – the fact that the MoC would fail to reach a satisfactory conclusion about pretty much any phenomenon/concept at which it was directed."
