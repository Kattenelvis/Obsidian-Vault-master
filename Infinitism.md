Good comment:
"-What worries me about infinitism are the rules of inference, I mean any rule for epistemic/logical reasoning and not just deductive rules. 
-I may justify a rule A with the set of Rules S. Now S has to exclude A to avoid circularity. 
-Now I want to justify another rule B from S with a smaller set of rules S*. But S* is basically S just without B. 
-It seems like I have now less and less rules until only one or a irreducible small set of rules is left over. 
-It seems like that a infinite chain of reasoning is not possible for rules of inference, infinitism therefore fails at least when it comes to rules. 

-When it comes to foundationalism, then I would probably use not believes about appearances but instead the appearances themselves as the foundation. 
-I would tend to think that I don’t need representations like believes for something I have direct access to. 
-But I think what worries me the most about foundationalism are the rules of inference. 
-If there is no solid foundation for the truth tracking tendency of those rules then it seems like I can’t do much with a rock solid foundation in the form of appearances."


Omg the myth of the given might only apply to beliefs about appearances, but when it comes to appearences themselves, then there are no higher order knowledge which justify beliefs about appearances such as concepts about "green" e.t.c.
