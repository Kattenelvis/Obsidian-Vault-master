Kripke's Adoption problem and Global Scepticism

Angrippan


Argument from Error
$\diamond B(p)\wedge \neg p$



1. In-depth investigated and rejected responses to scepticism: Moorean, abductive, contextualist, closure-denial (relevant alternatives, sensitivity, etc.), epistemic externalist (theories of knowledge, e.g. causal theory), semantic externalist, pragmatic, pragmatist, ordinary language philosophy, hinge epistemology, default knowledge, positist, pure/impure coherentist, infinitist, self-justifying propositions, phenomenal conservatist, direct realist, acquaintance/sense-data theory, innate knowledge, reflective equilibrium responses. To investigate:
    
    - No reason to doubt responses
    - alethic anti-realist responses
    - epistemic constitutivism (Kantian and non-Kantian variaties)
    
    contrastivism
    
    - Quinean holism
    - conceptual engineering
    
    works structurally, but hard to convince myself of:
    
    - analytic German idealist disjunctivism
    
    Currently investigating: Kantian constitutivism

We will take skepticism seriously, how to answer, deal with or debunk the long list of sceptical scenarious is how we found our epistemology anyways.

1. Humean skepticism, how do you justify induction? Not via deduction nor induction?
2. Cartesian/External world skepticism, how do you know you're not being systematically deceived?
	1. Brain in Vat
	2. Simulation
	3. Evolutionary
3. Semantic Skepticism
	1. Quus kripkenstein
	2. Untranslatable, can never understand eachother
5. Memory skepticism
6. Problem of the criterion: How do we "know" the criterions of knowledge?
7. Phyrronian Skepticism: Can you even know that an argument for sceptical skeptical scenarios hold?
8. Metaphilosophical skepticism


Self-defeating scepticism
