"For any expression used in a given language, there are at least two incompatible hypotheses about its meaning which equally well – and unimprovably – explain all observable aspects of its use in that language"

This still leaves room for false hypothesizes which do not explain all observable aspects of the uses in a language.

"Weak versions will contend that some questions about the meaning of an expression are indeterminate; 

Strong versions of the thesis will contend that all questions about the meaning of an expression are indeterminate."

"s emphasized, Quine is content to grant to the radical interpreter the ability to recognize native speakers’ assent to and dissent from sentences formulated in their language, and the ability to interact with them at least to the extent of eliciting assent to or dissent from particular such sentences. In consequence, the translator will be able – except in the most recalcitrant case – to arrive at empirically confirmed generalizations about which types of situation provoke assent to or dissent from instances of a particular sentence‐type. Now Quine is content, in Word and Object, to resurrect a surrogate for the notion of synonymy which, in “Two dogmas of empiricism,” he so roundly rejected: two sentences are said to be stimulus synonymous just in case assent to and dissent from them is provoked by the same sensory circumstances"



Oh a gavagai! That means rabbit right? 

"There are, that is, a number of concepts besides rabbit which, in exhibiting the observed patterns of assent and dissent, the natives could just possibly be exercising. Some of these are, respectively, the concepts of: undetached rabbit part, instantaneous temporal stage of a rabbit, rabbithood (the universal), rabbit‐fusion (the scattered physical aggregate of all rabbits), and rabbiting (taken as analogous to the feature‐placing concepts, thunder and rain)."

"For example, suppose we are in a position to put the question, “How many gavagai are there over there?” or “Is that the same gavagai that we saw five minutes ago?” Then the correct answers are bound to vary according to whether or not “gavagai” means: rabbit, or: undetached rabbit part, or: stage of a rabbit, respectively. For one rabbit is many undetached rabbit parts; and stages of a rabbit, unlike rabbits themselves, have no temporal duration."

For instance, if we're talkinga bout rabbit-fusion, then two rabbits (the way rabbit is used in english) would have different truth conditions when asking if it's the same as earlier. Yes, according to rabbit-fusion and rabbit-universal. But a temporal stage rabbit of one gavagai might be no, even though it's the same rabbit.
