Combining theories: Associationist thetory of thought, mental causation, connectivist theory of mental content (can be replaced by mentalese/computational theory of mental content)

Thoughts have associations. Some thoughts causes other thoughts to arise. "Cat" can cause thoughts of "feline", "animal", or a mental image of a cat (for most people, black cat). 
Here is a causal diagram

Where each node is a mentalese symbol in the connectionist theory of mental content where thought of one causes the other. It's mental to mental causation.

Of course, this system can be analysed by neuroscience

Just like in SEP page metaphysics of causation, there can exist causal interactions which hinder some associations being fired. A blocker. 


Crossword puzzle's (and some other things) mess up associations by creating causal loops of linguistically similar mental content rather than conceptually similar mental content. 



[Associationist Theories of Thought (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Winter 2021 Edition)](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/associationist-thought/)




Associationists theories generally employ only one singular mental process: That of associations where X associates with Y, as a causal process even perhaps. "Though many later associationists, such as Pavlov and the behaviorists, had only one mental process, Hume also had the imagination. For discussion on how the imagination meshes with Hume’s empiricism and associationism see Fodor (2003)."

idea1 is associated with idea2 iff impression1 is associated with impression 2

## Associative Structure

"An associative activation map (sometimes called a “spreading activation” map, Collins and Luftus 1975) is a mapping for a single thinker of all the associative connections between concepts.[[18](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/associationist-thought/notes.html#note-18)]"


William James called it a "stream of thought" as one thought goes to the next. This is an process of multiple associations being activated one after the other. 


## Associationist Transitions

Associationists is unlike the Computational theory of mind in that transitions between thoughts are based not on logical or formal properties of the thoughts (such as a modus ponens inference) and instead based on pure associations given on what one has previously encountered. Example being a transition from "It's cold in here" to "Russia should annex Idaho" (lmao what a good example from SEP) not because of any formal property but either because specific words have associations (cold, Russia, Idaho) or because the two sentences co-associated.

This is really interesting and very Humean.

Very interesting psychological effect! Something I've noticed myself! Explains why conversations and streams of thought are the way they are.
