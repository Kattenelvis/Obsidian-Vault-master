On rare occasions, I have the following mental states:
- Many small scattered thoughts, as background noise, shifting about once or even twice per second, multiple thoughts at once.
- Fast beating heartrate
- Tension in the body


How (maybe?) to fix (according to a trick I had to invent yesterday):

- Zen meditation doesn't work, the problem isn't latching onto thoughts but thoughts being tiny and scattered. If you don't latch onto thoughts, they will just keep being scattered
- Instead, attach to the thoughts, purposefully lengthen any such thought into something ridiculously long. Example thought: "Oh how I am in bed right now and this pillow right here is cold and nice there is a lamp there next to me I like that lamp" in a very slow thinking voice to ensure that it's not too fast. 
- BREATHE! I was not breathing enough, so of course the heart had to keep beating to keep my body oxygenated. The thoughts can even focus on my breathing. 
- Eventually one should be relaxed enough to either fall asleep, or be able to properly perform Zen meditation.
- After that I was an eepy wiw kitty for the next 4 hours.
- I also walked around a bit, and being all like "I CAN'T FUCKING SLEEP IT'S BEEN 6 HOURS" but I don't think that helped
