Idea: The SEP article discusses omnipotence in the context of a newtonian universe and prooving that there can only exist one omnipotent object by a reductio. If there existed two omnipotent objects, then they could apply equal and opposite force on the same object. So an object $O$ in space would be applied by $F$ and $-F$. But can this be generalized to quantum mechanics? Imagine a quantum field $Q$. A certain region of the $Q$ could be excited by two omnipotent beings in equal and opposite ways aswell. So the argument may hold for QFT aswell.

Countable infinity vs Uncountably infinite power.

Absolute infinity, Frege and God

A character that's infinitely powerful, but only countably infinite, would not be able to defeat God.
