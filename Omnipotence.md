Idea: The SEP article discusses omnipotence in the context of a newtonian universe and prooving that there can only exist one omnipotent object by a reductio. If there existed two omnipotent objects, then they could apply equal and opposite force on the same object. So an object $O$ in space would be applied by $F$ and $-F$. But can this be generalized to quantum mechanics? Imagine a quantum field $Q$. A certain region of the $Q$ could be excited by two omnipotent beings in equal and opposite ways aswell. So the argument may hold for QFT aswell.
