Theories of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity"), beginning with [gauge gravitation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_gravitation_theory "Gauge gravitation theory"), also postulate the existence of a gauge boson known as the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton").Gauge symmetries can be viewed as analogues of the [principle of general covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_general_covariance "Principle of general covariance") of general relativity in which the coordinate system can be chosen freely under arbitrary [diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") of spacetime. Both gauge invariance and diffeomorphism invariance reflect a redundancy in the description of the system. An alternative theory of gravitation, [gauge theory gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_gravity "Gauge theory gravity"), replaces the principle of general covariance with a true gauge principle with new gauge fields.
