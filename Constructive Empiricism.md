"Fraassen does not offer a full-fledged account of literalness in _The Scientific Image_, he does offer the following two necessary conditions for a theory’s being understood literally:

1. The theory’s claims are genuine statements capable of truth or falsity.
2. Any literal construal of a theory cannot change the logical relationships among the entities claimed by the theory—“most specifically, if a theory says that something exists, then a literal construal may elaborate on what that something is, but will not remove the implication of existence” (1980, 11)."


"### 1.3 Contrast with Logical Positivism

One of the reasons constructive empiricism is viewed as significant is that it carries on the tradition of the logical positivists without being saddled with the problematic aspects of the positivists’ positions. The constructive empiricist follows the logical positivists in rejecting metaphysical commitments in science, but she parts with them regarding their endorsement of the verificationist criterion of meaning, as well as their endorsement of the suggestion that theory-laden discourse can and should be removed from science. Before van Fraassen’s _The Scientific Image_, some philosophers had viewed scientific anti-realism as dead, because logical positivism was dead. Van Fraassen showed that there were other ways to be an empiricist with respect to science, without following in the footsteps of the logical positivists."


"To make this clear, we can, following van Fraassen (1998, 213), make the following terminological distinction:

> _scientific agnostic_: someone who believes the science s/he accepts to be empirically adequate but does not believe it to be true, nor believes it to be false.
> 
> _scientific gnostic_: someone who believes the science s/he accepts to be true.

It’s clear, in light of this distinction, that one can be a scientific gnostic and a constructive empiricist—one would simply choose to have beliefs that go beyond what science is aiming at. There is, of course, a connection between the scientific realist/constructive empiricist dichotomy and the scientific gnostic/scientific agnostic dichotomy:

> Scientific realists think that the scientific gnostic truly understands the character of the scientific enterprise, and that the scientific agnostic does not. The constructive empiricist thinks that the scientific gnostic may or may not understand the scientific enterprise, but that s/he adopts beliefs going beyond what science itself involves or requires for its pursuit. (van Fraassen 1998, 213–214)"



"Here is a rough-and-ready characterization of what it is for a theory to be empirically adequate:

> a theory is empirically adequate exactly if what it says about the observable things and events in the world is true—exactly if it ‘saves the phenomena.’ (van Fraassen 1980, 12)

A sufficiently unreflective constructive empiricist might adopt this construal of empirical adequacy for her theory, but a more sophisticated constructive empiricist would probably embrace an account of empirical adequacy akin to that which van Fraassen develops later in _The Scientific Image_.

To understand that account, one needs first to appreciate the difference between the _syntactic view_ of scientific theories and van Fraassen’s preferred _semantic view_ of scientific theories. On the syntactic view, a theory is given by an enumeration of theorems, expressed in some one particular language. In contrast, on the semantic view, a theory is given by the specification of a class of structures (describable in various languages) that are the theory’s models (the determinate structures of which the theory holds true). As van Fraassen says,

> To present a theory is to specify a family of structures, its models; and secondly, to specify certain parts of those models (the empirical substructures) as candidates for the direct representation of observable phenomena. (1980, 64)

A theory is empirically adequate, then, if appearances—“the structures which can be described in experimental and measurement reports” (1980, 64)—are isomorphic to the empirical substructures of some model of the theory. Roughly speaking, the theory is empirically adequate if the observable phenomena can “find a home” within the structures described by the theory—that is to say, the observable phenomena can be “embedded” in the theory. See Figure 1 for a graphical illustration of the relations that make a theory empirically adequate on van Fraassen’s view, with the cloud shapes representing the relata of the isomorphism relation.

Figure 1. A Theory’s Empirical Adequacy

This conception of a theory’s empirical adequacy is arguably what allows a constructive empiricist to avoid the kind of doxastic commitment Friedman (1982, 278) and Rochefort-Maranda (2011, 61–62) describe as posing a problem for the constructive empiricist (a problem that Rochefort-Maranda subsequently attempts to solve). Here is that problem:

> Since we might initially think that sentences about observables are, according to a theory, equivalent to certain sentences about unobservable entities, we might also think that commitment to belief in the existence of the observables undesirably commits the constructive empiricist to the existence of the corresponding unobservable entities. (And so correspondingly, agnosticism about the unobservables undesirably commits the constructive empiricist to agnosticism about the equivalent observables.)

The constructive empiricist arguably dissolves this problem by invoking the above conception of empirical adequacy. (Rochefort-Maranda gestures in the direction of, but does not explicitly describe, this dissolution in his footnote 1.) Belief that a theory is empirically adequate amounts to the belief that the observables can be properly embedded in at least one of the theory’s models. Belief in the possibility of that embedding does not require the constructive empiricist to take the truth of sentences about observables to entail the truth of sentences about unobservables. By taking a theory to be empirically adequate, the constructive empiricist is simply saying that the phenomena we observe (and believe to exist) can exist within the structure the theory describes, without additionally being committed to saying that the unobservable parts of that theoretical structure are parts of the actual structure of the world.

Note that the phenomena relevant to a theory’s empirical adequacy are all actual observ_able_ phenomena (1980, 12). So for a theory to be empirically adequate, it has to be able to account for more than just the phenomena that have actually been observed and the phenomena that will be observed. See Section 3.4 below for a discussion of the worry that the constructive empiricist’s belief in the empirical adequacy of her accepted theories thereby extends beyond what a bona fide empiricist ought to believe."
