Two Dogmas of empiricism

Against Kant's notion of analyticity which restricts to predicate-object relations and where it's left at a metaphorical level

Creature with Kidney and Creature with Hearth has the same extension but differ in meaning(isn't it almost the same though? Yeah that's his point!)

Same extension of two terms does not imply they are necessarily the same?

"All X are X" and "no X is non-X" are no problematic, "All X are Y" is problematic. What's the definition of synonymyty for X are Y

"27" is Synonymys with "twenty-seven", not by convention, but because of the ideas contained in the words

While we can replace "widower" with "man whose spouse has died" in the sentence "Jack became a widow" salva veritate (preserving truth) we cannot do the same with sentences"widower has 7 letters " (Objektspråk och Metaspråk?)

What if X and Y must have the same extension in all possible worlds. But this requires a notion of being able to replace words in sentances which makes it circular.

Make a long list of analytic statements? No criterion, woluld require stuff, otherwise stuff feels like analytic with no way of knowing it's the good list.




"In short, the Quinean methodology looks something like this: 
1. One cites some theorem φ in logical metatheory. 
2. One argues that φ has certain philosophical consequences, e.g., makes a certain view untenable."
From the logic in the philosophy of science

"One case where he is explicit is in his 1940 paper with Nelson Goodman, where he “proves” that every synthetic truth can be converted to an analytic truth."




The indispensability argument:

Q1 We should belive in the theory that cohers with sense experience.
Q2 If we believe a theory, then we must believe in all it's ontological commitments
Q3 The ontological commitments of any theory are the terms which it first-order quantifies over
Q4 The theory which cohers with our theory the most contains mathematical objects
Q5 Therefore one should have an ontological commitment for mathematical objects


We quantify over scientific objects when describing our best theories in first order logic, therefore we should believe that they exist. 


Quoted in Ladyman naturalized metaphysics:

"The technical aims of positivism and logical empiricism—to show how all meaningful discourse can be reduced to, or at least rigorously justified by reference to, reports of observations regimented for communication and inference by formal linguistic conventions—have been shown to be unachievable. Nevertheless, the positivists, following the lead of Hume and Russell before them, introduced into (non-continental) philosophy a profound respect for empirical science and its pre-eminence in all inquiry that continues to be the basis of the philosophical project. We may no longer believe in the verificationist theory of meaning, in the myth of the given, or in the analytic–synthetic distinction. Nevertheless, it is in the spirit of the positivists that we can say, with Quine, ‘philosophy of science is philosophy enough’. (Quine 1953[1966], 151)⁷"
