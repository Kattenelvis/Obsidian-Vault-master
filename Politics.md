Take lessons from this guy. 1. Be informed about your topic and its wider implications. 2. Don't talk down to the people listening, twice he acknowledged the audience and didn't dismiss or belittle them either time. 3. DRIVE YOUR POINTS. He drove taxing multinationals, getting royalties to invest into retraining and creating new jobs and no new fossil fuel projects. 4. Don't get distracted, if your opposition makes a false claim or tries to twist your words, gently and firmly correct them and then drive your points again. Bloody masterclass in handling hostile interviews.

Plan: Curb two industries: The tech industry and the carbon intensive industries.

//TODO: Revise these proposals and find problems with them and how to resolve those problems. 

## The carbon intensive industries

They are to be either nationalized or ran under a public-private joint ownership where they are only allowed to be ran if they are consistently pushing out their sustainability goals and showing that they are actually making progress by for example, decreasing carbon emissions. Costs sustained through expensive global trade might be facilitated by government grants to sell their goods cheaper on the world market, incentivising similar structures in other countries. 


## The tech industry

Existensial risks regarding AI needs to be curved. The most advanced model is to be closed sourced, except for AI safety research teams who are allowed to analyse the code. When they are deemed safe, they are to be open sourced. 
Questions: Who are the so called "AI safety research teams" and how are those individuals selected?
Tech industry needs its funding curbed for AI with the end goal of applying safe, interpretable, truthful, aligned, controlled e.t.c AI that can be used in as many parts of society as possible until the eventual complete automation of human society and the progress towards the singularity.
