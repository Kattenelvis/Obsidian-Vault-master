Memory exists:
1. The Church-Turing thesis is true i.e effective procedures are computational procedures
2. Humans can perform effective procedures
3. A computational procedure are only capable of simulating computational procedures at similar and lower level of the Chomsky hierarchy (FST can only simulate FST, PDA can simulate PDA and FST, Turing machines can simulate Turing machines, PDA and FST).
4. Humans can simulate PDA's and Turing Machines
5. PDA's and Turing machines have an internal state ("memory")
6. Humans have memory.

Idea: Simplify above proof, perhaps with choice sequences

[Epistemological Problems of Memory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/memory-episprob/)

Declarative Memory has two types of memory:
Episodic memory whose content is a mental representation of an event
Semantic memory whose content is a proposition


Recent research indicates episodic memory is constructive, generative. (Schacter 1996, 2001) and not just occasionally but normally (Michaelian 2011b, 2016)

"Episodic memory is generative, but not in general at the cost of truth. Puddifoot and Bortolotti (2019) argue, for instance, that the cognitive mechanisms responsible for certain false memory beliefs are indeed “epistemically innocent” , as they overall increase a subject’s chances of having other true beliefs or knowledge (see also Bortolotti and Sullivan-Bissett 2018)"

"  
The epistemic theory places an epistemic necessary condition on remembering. More specifically, propositional remembering requires knowing (Anscombe 1981; Ayer 1956; Audi 2002; Locke 1971; Malcolm 1963; Moon 2013; Owens 2000; Pappas 1980; Williamson 2000). Any subject who remembers that _p_ knows that _p_. [...]  If knowing requires believing, remembering requires it too. If knowing requires truth, so does remembering. And so on."

Bridge law for memory-logic:
$Mp\rightarrow Kp$
With additional assumptions:
$Kp\rightarrow Bp$ 
$Kp\rightarrow p$
So it follows that
$Mp\rightarrow Bp$
$Mp\rightarrow p$

"Stronger versions of the epistemic theory say that remembering at a moment requires knowing not only then but also previously. They add, moreover, that that earlier knowing explains, or bears some other special connection to, the later knowing. Any subject who remembers that _p_ at a moment knows that _p_ then because she knew that _p_ before."

"A more common criticism of the epistemic theory is that knowledge requires something that remembering does not (Bernecker 2010; see also Audi 1995; Lai 2022). One form of the criticism goes as follows. Knowledge roughly requires good and undiminished reason to believe. Suppose you remember that _p_—you’ve come to know that _p_ and therefore have reason good enough for knowing that _p_. Later you gain reason to doubt that _p_ (see discussion of defeaters in [Section 2.2.3](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/memory-episprob/#ProbForgDefe)). Your reason to believe that _p_ is no longer good enough for knowing that _p_. But can you now remember that _p_? The epistemic theory must say, perhaps unintuitively, you cannot. Perhaps even worse, the epistemic theory seems to imply that you remembered that _p_ up until you gained the reason to doubt. So you recently remembered that _p_, but can remember no longer, and not because of any forgetting. It’s because of some learning—your gaining reason to doubt. It may instead be more plausible to suppose the epistemic theory is mistaken. Remembering does not require good and undiminished reason to believe, in which case it does not require knowing.

Also, if the epistemic theory is correct, there is no remembering falsely. Knowledge requires truth. Remembering, if it requires knowing, also requires truth. Propositional _mis_remembering, then, isn’t remembering at all. At best it’s mere apparent remembering. It’s not memory’s doing. In other words, whether a subject is remembering that _p_ is not settled by the mechanisms that produce _p_ as an output for the subject and by the functions of those mechanisms. Instead, the accuracy of _p_ also matters for whether the subject counts as remembering. The epistemic theory is only as plausible as this consequence (cf. De Brigard 2014).

Finally, the epistemic theory’s prospects may depend on the empirical matter of whether and how memory is generative. Perhaps research in neuroscience and cognitive psychology could make it plausible that propositional remembering is in some cases generative. This would doom at least the stronger versions of the epistemic theory. Knowing that _p_ in the past would be unnecessary for remembering that _p_ now, if memory can generate _p_ as the content of some propositional remembering."

"Defenses of the epistemic theory tend to suggest that its alternatives are themselves flawed (Adams 2011; James 2017) or that the alleged counterexamples to it are insufficiently clear (Moon 2013; Sakuragi 2013)." More like copium am I right


## Justification and Memory

Memory might be a foundation for justification under foundationalism. "Visual perception provides justification for believing how spatially distant things are. Memory simply provides justification for believing how temporally distant things are (Taylor 1956)."

"Coherence might not create justification, but it may increase any already present (Lewis 1946)."

"Thanks to memory you might have several beliefs that all fit together. If these beliefs are already justified, their fitting together could boost their justification. And even if coherence does not help, incoherence may hurt (Audi 1995; Olsson 2017). A poor fit among recollections might eliminate justification that memory would otherwise help provide."

"A few apparent epistemological problems of memory may favor externalism over internalism. One of these is the problem of forgotten evidence (Goldman 1999; Harman 1986; Owens 1999; Pappas 1980; see also Frise 2015 [[Other Internet Resources](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/memory-episprob/#Oth)]; Huemer 1999; Madison 2017; McCain 2015). We tend to use evidence when forming justified beliefs. But we also tend to forget this evidence, even while continuing to believe. Pappas (1983: 266 n.1) thinks “one typically loses one’s original justification”. When the originally justified belief is kept but the original evidence for it is not, its justification might be replaced by other justification, or lost and not replaced, or not lost at all. In many cases it is intuitive that the kept belief is still justified one way or another. The problem of forgotten evidence is that of explaining how this could be."

"Some externalist theories seem to have an explanation readily available. One such theory is process reliabilism (see entry on [reliabilist epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reliabilism/)). Very roughly, it says a belief’s justification depends on the reliability of the process that forms or keeps the belief. Memory seems relevantly reliable. Even if a subject forgets her original evidence for a belief that was originally justified and that she keeps, she may keep the belief due to a reliable memory process. Reliabilism appears able to explain how the belief is still justified—it’s because of the memory process’s reliability."




### Scepticism

"Or perhaps if memory is to provide justification for a subject, she must have reason to suppose her memory is trustworthy. It is not immediately obvious what the relevant trustworthiness consists in. It may be a matter of memory functioning in a certain way. And this could be a matter of memory in general being reliable, tending to yield more true beliefs than false beliefs. **A potential reason to suppose memory is reliable is that to suggest otherwise is, in a way, self-defeating (Locke 1971). To show memory is unreliable, we’d presumably need to cite evidence of its failures. But this evidence comes from memory. So if we show memory is unreliable, it is because memory supported believing something, namely, its own unreliability. So even if it is plausible that memory is unreliable, memory supports some believing.**"

"It might not matter whether memory _in general_ is reliable. Perhaps it just matters whether memory is reliable in the right circumstances or for a certain range of beliefs, or whether a given memory system is reliable, or whether a given memory is likely correct. An inference to the best explanation argument supports the latter: a given memory, if accurate, can make better sense of why a subject now experiences what that memory predicts she would experience (Hasan 2021)."
