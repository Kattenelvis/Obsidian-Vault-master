> Machine Psychology is developed in this thesis as an interdisciplinary ap proach that unifies several disciplinary approaches. In particular, this thesis concerns an integration between **learning psychology** (De Houwer & Hughes, 2020) in the **operant psychology tradition** of BF Skinner (Skinner, 1938) and **Relational Frame Theory** (Hayes et al., 2001), with the **Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System**, a particular AI model developed by Pei Wang (Wang, 2013, 2022).
