Centralization vs Decentralization
< idea >

Graph theory + information theory
Each node represents a point of agency, information integration and decision making. 

The two radical viewpoints are easy to define:

Radical decentralization: No edges, only nodes. Deg(x) = 0 for every node.

Radical Centralization: One node and all edges point to this one node. Deg(x) = 1 for every node.

Then it gets difficult. Which graph-theoretic measure to use for centrality?

Two subgraphs: Information paths and decision paths. 
Most optimal? Probably when they are equal but idk.  

The network changes over time, different nodes are in game-theoretic games between eachother, different voting systems and information integration at each node.
