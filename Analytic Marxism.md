Marxist materialism as extended form non-cooperative coalition games with dynamics where the results over time impact coalitions in dynamic ways.

Individuals form self-interested coalitions to engage in game-theoretic payout situations to maximize their own utility function/preference relation.

At each timestep, they "vote" (impact) on how to change the world in some way. This changes the world-state at each time.

This in turn changes the members of the group, changes the number of members, changes their utility function
