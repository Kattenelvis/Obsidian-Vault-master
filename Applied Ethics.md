    The argument essentially goes like so; letting kE denote performing E, an action, k times.
    
    1. If it is good to _n_X even if _n_X-ing causes _n_Y, then it is good to _(n+1)_X even if it causes _(n+1)_Y,
    2. It is good to save one child even if it causes you to lose 2 dollars,
    3. Ergo, it is good to save _n_ children even if it causes you to lose _2n_ dollars for all _n_,



Idea: Methods for applying normative ethical systems to applied ethics. Are applied cases generalized to normative ethical cases (sorta particularism) or are metaethical systems used to deduce rules in applied ethics (sorta universalism)

The standard view in academic philosophy seems to be that abortion is murder and abortion is morally permissible. I agree

Definition: [[Philosophy of Biology]]: Being Alive(x) <--> (Enclosed Spatial region(x) & Homestatic process(x) & Engaging in extropic processes(x) & 2 more things I forgot)

A fetus is alive by upholding above properties, even if they are of a parasitic nature. 

Definition: Murder is agential action which causes the world state to change from at $t$ where Alive(x) is true, to the state of the world at $t+1$ to be such that $\neg$Alive(x).

Abortion thus causes a fetus to no longer have most of its life bearing properties. Hence Abortion is murder. 

I still think it is morally permissible though, given my current moral views (humean constructivist social contractarian leximin-rule utiltitarianism).

Capturing stem-cells is not murder. 

It seems that the violinist thought experiment is used to show that murder can be morally permissible, or atleast that some of us has intuitions with that regard.
