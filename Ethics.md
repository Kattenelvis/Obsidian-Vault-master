the principle of alternate possibilities." This principle states that a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise.

Frankfurt-cases has an argument against this

Idea:

When I asser that "should be the case that p" I'm implying that 
1. I believe $\neg p$. 
2. I believe $\diamond p$ 
3. I believe p is "good" or "desirable"

"The grounding of absolute morality requires surmounting some hurdles, including Euthyphro’s dilemma, Hume’s guillotine, and Moore’s naturalistic fallacy."



All humans equal worth thesis: Define a value function $V:obj\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function from one's ontology to the real numbers. In simple terms, "The object $x$ has value $V(x)$"
$\forall x. H(x)\rightarrow \forall y V(x)=V(y)$

$V$ could be generalized to any total order, perhaps even to partial orders (though I don't know how to generalize it to partial orders). 
I don't know why people claim this is true.
