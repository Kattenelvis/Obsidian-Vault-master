Argument for Externalism: water is H2O on earth and twoter is XYZ on twin earth. Therefore environmental factors determine semantic content despite mental state's not differing between a human and twoman. 

But there is a problem.
1. Concievability implies possibility/Modal rationalism is true (assumption)
2. Semantic Externalism is true (assumption)
3. We can concieve of oureslves as being brains in a vat (assumption/thought experiment)
4. So it is possible that we can be brains in a vat (1. and 3.)
5. If semantic externalism is true, then whenever we refer to ordinary objects we're in a connection with the object itself (assumption)
6. The vatted world does not contain such objects themselves (assumption)
7. Words fail to refer (by 4,5,6)

Ruh-roh! But Lewis and Stalnaker have developed an advanced type of internalism using 2D semantics.
