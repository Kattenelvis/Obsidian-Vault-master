Extrinsic properties can be used to derive intrinsic properties (a is father of b therefore a is a man) but not the other way around. The inference also destroys some information. Idea: Can I prove this to always be the case?


Surprisingly high quality for being tik-tok. It's asking very interesting questions in metaphysics about supervenience, mereology and time. My own view on those topics are not very strong, I can see them all going either way, but I could make the following cases for the viewpoints:

Supervenience: Let x, y be two components of A. Then x, y have extrinsic properties "part of A" true for both and "together in A with x" is a property of y and "together in A with y" is a property of x. Let's also say that A supervenes on x,y, that is to say, if x or y would be different, then A would be different. Now for the question in the tiktok, is A = {x,y} or not? This will depend on our notion on identity of reference, but let's use description theory of reference. Do they describe the same thing? Does A and {x,y} have the exact same description/set of properties? Well, A certainly doesn't have any of the relational properties. But the set {x,y} doesn't either. Likewise, if x or y is different, so is {x,y}, just as with A. It seems like they pick out the same object, so I'll go with a yes.

Mereology: I take on the view that mereological nihilism/universalism is not an important debate for anything (the light ontology viewpoint I think it's called). It's a choice of some language to pick whether or not three atoms x, y, z (imagine them in a box) is three objects (mereological nihilism) or seven objects (mereological universalism) or something in-between. Any property can split up any set of atoms into any system, it's a choice in our language for some theory. 

Time: Don't wanna get started on this one but probably A-theory since we only directly observe the now. This way it doesn't rely on sceptical arguments on the existence of the past/future being false unlike B-Theory.
