Neurath Bootstrapping

We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat#cite_note-antispengler-2)

[Keith Stanovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Stanovich "Keith Stanovich"), in his book _The Robot's Rebellion_, refers to it as a **Neurathian bootstrap**, using [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping "Bootstrapping") as an analogy to the [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) nature of revising one's beliefs.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat#cite_note-Stanovich-10) A "rotten plank" on the ship, for instance, might represent a [meme virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme "Meme") or a junk meme (i.e., a meme that is either maladaptive to the individual, or serves no beneficial purpose for the realization of an individual's life goals). It may be impossible to bring the ship to shore for repairs, therefore one may stand on planks that are not rotten in order to repair or replace the ones that are. At a later time, the planks previously used for support may be tested by standing on other planks that are not rotten:

> We can conduct certain tests assuming that certain [memeplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memeplex "Memeplex") (e.g., science, logic, rationality) are foundational, but at a later time we might want to bring these latter memeplexes into question too. The more comprehensively we have tested our interlocking memeplexes, the more confident we can be that we have not let a meme virus enter into our mindware...[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat#cite_note-Stanovich-10): 181 

In this way, people might proceed to examine and revise their beliefs so as to become more [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational "Rational").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat#cite_note-Stanovich-10): 92
