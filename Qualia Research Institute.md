Hello, I'm interested at helping out the Qualia Research Institute in the following ways:

1. Help with web development, specifically fixing the search function on the wiki and other potential issues.
   
2. Helping as a wiki editor, writing articles for the QRI wiki

3. Research partnership

My name is Emil Svenberg, I have almost finished my degree in logic, philosophy & mathematics at Stockholm University, I have 4 years professional experience as a web-developer, and I have been really excited for years about what the qualia research institute does. I've come with an offer to help out with QRI.

I have been in talk with the main wiki editor Silver, and was intrigued by the opportunity of being paid while helping out QRI. She can also attest that I'm not just some random but that I know philosophy. I would love to help add pages, flesh things out and so on. And I was annoyed that search didn't work, and thought I could help out. 

I have also written what I think is unique research that is in the vein of QRI. I build a minimal description of qualia space using finitist set theory (a very simple system with just 4 axioms). For instance, I consider each point in visual space to be a set {x,y,H,S,B} with x,y coordinates on a cartesian grid, and where each point has a hue (H), saturation (S) and brightness (B). I do something similar for auditory space with pitch-loudness pairs and so on, eventually building a space of possible experiences. I then consider how they change over time, and how systems changing over time can be described mathematically. I'm afraid this will be caught by spam filters if I send links, so I'll only send if you're interested. 

You don't have to accept me on all 3 points of course, or any at all. But I'm really hoping your as interested in bringing me onboard as I am on getting onboard!

Feel free to check out my attached CV

Thanks, Emil Svenberg.
