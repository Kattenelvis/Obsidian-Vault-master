Develpomental Psychology. From Shea's Representations: The tendency to see behaviour as goal-directed can in fact be activated by appropriate movements of geometric shapes, as well as human and animal behaviour. It develops early in childhood and seems to be an important precursor to an explicit understanding of others’ mental states (Abell et al. 2000, Aschersleben et al. 2008, Biro and Leslie 2007, Frith and Frith 1999, Gergely and Csibra 2003).


From "Classical Econphysics" by cockshott et al: "A goal is a representation of a state of affairs that does not exist plus a motivation to achieve it."
