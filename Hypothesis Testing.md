Idea: Multi-layered hypothesises (if this hypothesis is true, then $X$ hypothesises are true which each have observational statements $S$). Tree-like structure of hypothesises where testing the sub-hypothesises either confirms or disconfirms the main hypothesis.

Half-Idea: The best hypothesis which fits with the available data is one which coheres best with the rest of one's established belief system
