Causal vs Evidential decision theory. Does the causal one say "yes" and evidential "no"? Given that there's only one god and so on that eliminates other potential counterarguments



Counter Argument: One can create a low probability God such that it throws you into hell if you use Pascals Wager to believe in it then it sends you to hell.   

Potential counter-counter argument:

1) By a potential solution to St. Petersburg paradox, we disallow infinite utilities and low enough probability events can be rationally ignored, no matter the consequences.
2) We can rationally ignore such low probability Gods
3) We are rational to believe in God from Pascal's wager


Problem: How to determine the probability of a God existing? Can be sent to hell without God, it seems metaphysically possible? God may not send people to heaven or hell. Annihilation can still be true without God. 

Changed pascals wager: Actions that lead to very terrible consequences later on should be avoided, but low probability one's are not worth considering.
