Idea: Time-Symmetry: The laws in QFT and GR are time-symmetric, but statistical mechanics (atleast the statistical law of entropy) and cosmology (lambda CMD model predict expanding universe which also violates conservation of energy by stretching out the wavelengths of particles, decreasing their energy with seemingly nowhere for them to go).
