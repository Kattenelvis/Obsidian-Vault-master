Common cause, statistical non-independence despite causal independence between the two right propositions, caused by a single common cause on the left.

"The principle is significant because it posits a connection between causal structure and probabilistic correlations that licenses inferences to causal relationships from empirically observable correlations."




## Counterexamples

A number of authors have proposed counterexamples to the Common Cause Principle. A counterexample would involve two events _A_ and _B_ such that

- _A_ and _B_ are probabilistically correlated,
    
- neither event is a cause of the other, and
    
- the correlation between _A_ and _B_ cannot be explained by a common cause, either because they have no common cause, or because their common cause does not screen them off from one another.

Serious counter-examples for the RCCP: 
1. Genuinely probabilistic processes and conserved quantities
2. Time series
