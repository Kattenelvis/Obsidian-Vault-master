More detailed explanation:

Decision theory is a set of models to study the choices of a **single agent**, often in the face of uncertainty. It contains both predictions about how people behave, and normative prescriptions about how people should behave.

Within decision theory, you have two types of models. On one hand, you have rational models that assume that behavior is guided by a set of well defined objectives and the decision maker always processes information optimally and makes the best possible decisions in accordance with those objectives.

More precisely, the most common rational choice model is the maximization of subjective expected utility with exponential time discounting. What this means is that people have some utility function, and they always make choices that maximize its expectation given their subjective beliefs about uncertain events. The exponential discounting refers to a form of time preferences in which individuals always value the present more than the future, and the rate at which they discount future utility is constant.

It is important to highlight that many of the rational models are intended to be treated as “as if” models. We don’t really believe that people process information optimally and never make mistakes. Instead, the models can be transformed into empirical predictions. As long as the data matches those predictions, behavior can be modelled as if agents were rational. A good example of this is the seminal work of Savage: The Foundations of Statistics. This book becomes advanced at some point, but the introduction is very accessible and a fantastic read (and there are cheap Dover editions).

In contrast to rational models, there are behavioural models that try to model explicitly or implicitly the ways in which human behaviour systematically deviates from the predictions of rational models. For example, people tend to ignore small probabilities or small differences, people treat wins and losses asymmetrically, people tend to leave things to the very last minute, people hold expensive credit card debt and savings accounts at the same time, and so on. Some good texts here are Thinking Fast and Slow by Kanhenman and Tversky or Gut Feelings by Girgerenzer (probably misspelled his name but you’ll be able to find it).

Game theory is a set of models that study the choices of **more than one agent**. It is specifically relevant in situations where the preferred alternative for each agent depends on what other agents do. It is usually a positive (descriptive) discipline that makes predictions about the behaviour of groups.

Game theory is built upon decision theory. It uses mostly rational agents, but there is also a lot of work in behavioural game theory. This is specially true about the more empirical side of game theory, because the predictions of rational game theory models tend to fail miserably in experimental settings.

Game theory is divided into non-cooperative game theory which focuses on how self-centred selfish (there may be some debate about my use of the term selfish, I’m happy to elaborate if someone cares) individuals make decisions taking the decisions of others as given. In contrast, cooperative game theory studies how _groups_ of individuals make decisions.

A good read that explains the central issues that make game theory different from decision theory is Convention by David Lewis. Essentially, what makes game theory difficult is that there is some circular nature to it. What’s best for me depends on what I believe about your behavior, which depends on what I believe that you believe about my behaviour, which depends on what I believe that you believe about my behavior, which depends about what I believe that you believe that I believe about your behavior and so on and so forth. Game Theory made significant progress after Lewis came up with the notion of common knowledge as a way to avoid this type of never ending circular reasoning.

Social choice theory analyzes ways of aggregating individual preferences to form social criteria in order to determine which outcomes are better or worse for society. Some people may argue that it is part of cooperative game theory, other people may disagree. It is mostly a normative discipline. Social choice theory is not about making predictions but rather about figuring out how society _should_ make decisions.

The real challenge of social choice theory is that different people in society want different things. A homophone and a homosexual will have different opinions about what should be taught in public schools. If you want to take into account the conflicting preferences of different members of society, it is challenging to come up with a good criterion to determine what is good from a social perspective.

Social choice theory the way we know it today, originated for a 1962 paper by Kenneth Arrow that was transformed into a book called Social Choice and Individual Values. He identified a fundamental problem in the formulation of good social welfare functions when we only have ordinal data available. The book is a fantastic and accessible read that I strongly recommend. There is many precious work in welfare economics (Mill, Condorcet, Borda, Samuelson, Bergson, Harsanyi, etc). However, Arrow’s work transformed the field radically and most of the current efforts are centred around Arrow’s work.
