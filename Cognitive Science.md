Tokens of mental states is a relation between a creature, it's mental state, and the proposition that the mental state expresses.

Tokens of mental processes is a relation between a creature and a computation. A causal chain of operation on mental representations. 

"Alternatives float to the surface of the mentalist tradition from time to time, especially in discussions of perception. It’s possible, for example, to read the ‘direct’ realism of Reid (1983) and Gibson (1966) (and, recently, of McDowell 1994 and Putnam 2000) as ontologically committed to perceptual beliefs, and to mental processes that eventuate in their fixation, but as rejecting both the claim that perceiving requires mental representation and the claim that perception is, in any interesting sense, a species of inference. I don’t find direct realism remotely plausible as epistemology, still less as psychology.⁷ Be that as it may. What ‘direct’ realists aim for is mental realism without mental representation."

Direct Realism:
1. Ontologically commited to perceptual beliefs
2. Ontologically commited to mental processes 
3. Not ontologically commited to perception requires mental representation
4. Perception is not a type of inference

Is it direct because percieved objects don't "pass through" any mental representations. Perception about objects is a mental process that is immediately turned into a perceptual belief.

[Strange loop - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop)
**Gödel incompleteness --> No "I"?**
"According to Hofstadter, strange loops take form in human consciousness as the complexity of active symbols in the brain inevitably leads to the same kind of self-reference which [Gödel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del "Kurt Gödel") proved was inherent in any sufficiently complex logical or arithmetical system (that allows for arithmetic by means of the [Peano axioms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms "Peano axioms")) in his [incompleteness theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems "Gödel's incompleteness theorems").[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop#cite_note-1) Gödel showed that mathematics and logic contain strange loops: propositions that not only refer to [mathematical and logical truths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth"), but also to the symbol systems expressing those truths. This leads to the sort of paradoxes seen in statements such as "[This statement is false](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_statement_is_false "This statement is false")," wherein the sentence's basis of truth is found in referring to itself and its assertion, causing a logical paradox.[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop#cite_note-oreilly-2)

Hofstadter argues that the psychological self arises out of a similar kind of paradox. We are not born with an "I" – the [ego](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_(Freudian) "Ego (Freudian)") emerges only gradually as experience shapes our dense web of active symbols into a tapestry rich and complex enough to begin [twisting back upon itself](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference"). According to this view the psychological "I" is a narrative fiction, something created only from intake of symbolic data and its own ability to create stories about itself from that data. The consequence is that a perspective (a mind) is a culmination of a unique pattern of symbolic activity in our nervous systems, which suggests that the pattern of symbolic activity that makes identity, that constitutes subjectivity, can be replicated within the brains of others, and perhaps even in artificial brains.[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop#cite_note-oreilly-2)
