Utilitarian Mugging: For finite pain, a utilitarian may adopt a rule to not take a utilitarian mugging. Even if the mugger looses a finger, it prevents future fingers potentially being lost, or oneself becoming poor. What if the mugger tries to enter nozicks experience machine, for a highly painfull/suffering experience, for infinite time?




One world W1 has infinite number of sentient beings B1,...Bn are put in suffering states of consciousness and for each Bi they are put in pleasure states after i timesteps. 

In another world W2 they are put in pleasure states and put in suffering states after i timesteps. 

I will argue that time-dependent total utilitarianism prefers the W1, despite infinite suffering.

Calculating the utility for all agents across all time steps looks like this:
$$U_{total}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{x}\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}U(n,t)$$

Since $\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}U(n,t)$ will always be $+\infty$ in W1, this equation will be positive. Hence time-dependent total utilitarianism advises for the world of infinite suffering where each agent has a finite amount of suffering.
