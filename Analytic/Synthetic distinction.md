Definition of analyticity:
Kantian: The predicate is contained in the definition of the word
Frege: Interchangability $\phi[x]=\phi[c/x]$
Synonymyty
Definition

"But Kant's intent, evident more from the use he makes of the notion of analyticity than from his definition of it, can be restated thus: a statement is analytic when it is true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact. Pursuing this line, let us examine the concept of meaning which is presupposed." 
-Two dogmas

"taking a hint from Tooke7a we might rephrase this doctrine in semantical jargon by saying that a term, to be significant at all, must be either a name of a sense datum or a compound of such names or an abbreviation of such a compound. So stated, the doctrine remains ambiguous as between sense data as sensory events and sense data as sensory qualities; and it remains vague as to the admissible ways of compounding. Moreover, the doctrine is unnecessarily and intolerably restrictive in the termby-term critique which it imposes. More reasonably, and without yet exceeding the limits of what I have called radical reductionism, we may take full statements as our significant units -- thus demanding that our statements as wholes be translatable into sense-datum language, but not that they be translatable term by term."
Well that destroys everything I tried to do in [[World Model]]

With observational foundations there is no way of characterizing/having a base for the web of concepts of analyticity, interchangability, synonymity and definition. Forms a ring that is separate from the rest of the system.

When the analytic/synthetic distinction is gone, the difference between different fields of science/math/philosophy goes away, and philosophy is just discussing things at highest level of abstraction. 

The criticism by Quine is from within the system of logical empiricism. Kantians or similar rationalists who believe philosophy is synthetic a priori has no problem because they don't agree with the premisses of confirmation theory of meaning and empiricist foundationalism (like observation sentences, theoretical sentences and correspondence rules).

DUHEM!
We have a BACKGROUND THEORY!
