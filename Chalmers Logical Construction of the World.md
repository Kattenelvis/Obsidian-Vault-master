Based on epic book by Carnap

Inferential scrutability:
Compact class $\Gamma$ of propositions that proove all propositions that are true in the actual world. A laplacean mind is able to derive all laplacian truths $\Gamma \vdash p$. Such a being who knows all such propositions is a laplacian demon.


What if there exists $p$ such that $\Gamma \vdash p$ and $p=$"there is no laplacian demon?"

And what about other problems such as it being a part of the universe but knowing the entirety of the universe, or predicting its own actions. If there is a truth $q$ that the demon never comes to know, then it might not know that it doesn't know $q$. 


"To avoid these paradoxes, we can think of the demon as lying outside the world it is trying to know. Or better, we can think of the demon as contemplat ing the universe conditionally: if the Laplacean truths obtain, then this is what follows. Even if our own world does not contain a demon, we can still ask what a demon in some other world could come to know about our world, if it were given the relevant information in conditional form. Such a demon need not contemplate its own existence."

"Conditional Scrutability : There is a compact class of truths such that for all true propositions p , a Laplacean intellect would be in a position to know that if the truths in that class obtain, then p"

No need for extra empirical information:

"A Priori Scrutability : There is a compact class of truths such that for all true propositions p , a Laplacean intellect would be in a position to know a priori that if the truths in that class obtain, then p ."



# Chapter 1

Small set of primitive concepts derive all other concepts.

In Carnap, this reduces to A SINGLE concept and logic:  Similarity in sense-experirence


"Defi nability : There is a compact class of primitive expressions such that all expressions are defi nable in terms of that class."

"Late in the Auf bau , Carnap went on to argue that **phenomenal similarity is itself dispensable: it can itself be definedin logical terms**. If so, then primitive expressions can be restricted to logi cal expressions, and all other expressions can be defi ned in terms of these. Of course the general program of defi nability is not committed to as strong a claim as this."


Def C: C is E and F

Extensional adequacy: Definitions on left side and right side must be the same

Problem: Extensional equivalence, such as "all bachelors are untidy men", might be true in some possible world but doesn't seem to be a definition.

So intentional requirement of being a priori, analytic and/or necessary is needed

Carnap didn't take that into account!

"Th e stronger criteria of analyticity, apriority, and necessity ensure that an expression and its defi nition are connected semantically (that is, in the realm of meaning), epistemologically (in the realm of knowledge), and modally (in the realm of necessity and possibility)."

"Further potential criteria include psychologi cal criteria, to the eff ect that a defi nition somehow refl ects the psychological processes involved in understanding and using an expression; formal criteria, to the eff ect that defi nitions have a certain limited complexity; conceptual criteria, to the eff ect that the expressions used in the defi nition express concepts that are more basic (in some relevant sense) than the concept expressed by the original expression; and so on."

"On the Aufbau view, all truths are defi nitionally scrutable from a class of truths about the phenomenal similarity relation. In fact, Carnap holds that there is a single world-sentence D that defi nitionally entails all truths. Th e world-sen tence says that there exist entities that are related in such-and-such fashion by the phenomenal similarity relation R . If there are just two dissimilar total experi ences in the world, then the world-sentence will be a sentence saying that there are two entities that stand in R to themselves but not to each other: ∃ ∀ = ∨ , ( x y Rxx Ryy Rxy Ry & & & & x ww w y x ∼ ∼ ∼ = = & ) ) ( ) x y ( . If there are more total experiences than this, then there will be a longer world sentence, specify ing the similarity relations that do and do not hold among the total experiences."

The world sentence for two dissimilar phenomenal experiences
(so like, a red and blue phenomenal experience. Concrete experiences, not abstract qualia)

"According to Carnap’s stronger view late in the Aufbau , the previous world sentence D is defi nitionally entailed by an even more austere world sentence D ', using purely logical vocabulary. To get from D to D ', Carnap defi nes away the single nonlogical vocabulary item R as that relation that makes the previous world-sentence D true. 8 If this is correct, then the highly austere truth D ' defi ni tionally entails all truths"
