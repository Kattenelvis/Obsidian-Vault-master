"If you agree with the Consequence argument, then you can't be a compatibilist. The conclusion of the Consequence Argument is that determinism precludes alternative possibilities and therefore free will, this is mutually exclusive to compatibilism. Here's another formulation of the Consequence Argument: P = a complete description of the state the universe was in at some time in the remote past, e.g., at the time of the Big Bang L = a complete statement of all the laws of nature A = some action that I perform in the present Determinism = The view that the state of the universe at any given time, together with the laws of nature, determine a unique future. No matter what I do, P will remain the case. For any action that I can perform, if I perform it, the past will remain as it in fact was. Similarly, it seems no matter what I do, L will remain the case. Therefore, no matter what I do, (P & L) will be the case. But, if determinism is true, then (P & L) entails A. 1.No matter what I do, P. 2.No matter what I do, L. 3.Therefore, no matter what I do, (P & L). 4.If determinism, then (P & L) entails A. 5.Therefore, if determinism, then no matter what I do, A. That means that (given determinism) I have no alternative possibilities, so I lack free will."
